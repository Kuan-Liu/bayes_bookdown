## Introduction to Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods

- Oftentimes, the posterior distribution might not be easily determined (as in the case of conjugate models), especially when we are modelling multiple parameters

- We need numerical ways to compute posterior distribution

- Recall the posterior distribution takes form

\[P(\theta \mid y) = \frac{P(y \mid \theta) \times P(\theta)}{ P(y)} = \frac{P(y \mid \theta) \ P(\theta)}{ \int P(y \mid \theta) \ P(\theta) \ d\theta}\]
    - The denominator $\int P(y \mid \theta) \ P(\theta) \ d\theta$ is the challenging part to be determined numerically.

- Markov chain simulation is used when it is not possible or not computationally efficient to sample $\theta$ directly from $P(\theta \mid y)$

- instead we sample iteratively to draw from a distribution that becomes closer to $P(\theta \mid y)$

- Markov Chain simulation methods comprise a class of algorithms for sampling from a (complex) probability distribution and have application outside Bayesian statistics as well, especially in statistical optimization 
    - Markov chain is named after Russian mathematician [Andrey Markov (1856-1922)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Markov).
    - A Markov chain or Markov process is a stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event.


**Monte Carlo sampling**

- Notation: 
    - Let $\theta = (\theta_1, \ldots, \theta_p)$ be the collection of $p$ number of parameters in a Bayesian model
    - Let $Y = (Y_1, \ldots, Y_n)$ be the observed data of $n$ subjects
    - The posterior $P(\theta \mid Y)$ is a probability distribution
    - If $\theta^{(1)}, \ldots, \theta^{(s)}$ are $s$ samples from $P(\theta \mid Y)$, then the mean of the $s$ samples approximate the posterior mean!
    - This posterior draws provides approximations of the posterior summaries of interest (e.g., posterior mean, posterior medium, P(theta < 0.9), etc)
- How to draw samples from some arbitrary distribution $P(\theta \mid Y)$?
    - There are many algorithms and software options for performing MC sampling
    - Software: 
        - OpenBUGS, WinBUGS, JAGS; 
        - STAN; 
        - INLA (Iteratively Nested Laplace Approximation, this is not MC)
        - PyMC (via Python)

        
- In this session, we will introduce two MCMC algorithms: Metropolis algorithm and Gibbs sampler.
    - brms package uses stan which samples following Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm and No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS)
    - HMC is a bit more complex, we will not cover the algorithm in this session, for those who are interested see http://www.mcmchandbook.net/HandbookChapter5.pdf and [@hoffman2014no]
    - HMC is documented to be more efficient then Gibbs and Metropolis algorithm (less iterations are needed).

### Gibbs sampling

As a simple example, suppose we want to estimate mean $\mu$ and precision $\tau = 1/\sigma^2$ of a normal distribution. We place the priors $\mu \sim N(0,1)$ and $\tau \sim Gamma(1,1)$. 

\[ Y \mid \mu, \tau \sim N(\mu, \frac{1}{\tau})\]
\[\mu \sim N(0,1)\]
\[\tau \sim Gamma(1,1)\]

Then the conditional posterior distributions for $\mu$ and $\tau$ are

\[ P( \mu \mid \tau, Y) \propto N(\frac{\tau \sum_{i=1}^n y_i}{1 + n \tau},\frac{1}{1+n\tau})\]

\[ P( \tau \mid \mu, Y) \propto Gamma(1 + \frac{n}{2}, 1+\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-\mu)^2}{2})\]

We want to alternate between sampling from these two conditional posteriors.

- Let's simulate $n=100$ data, $Y$,  from N(10,1). The true data mean $\mu = 10$ and $\tau = 1$, our posterior distribution of $\mu$ and $\tau$ should approximate the true value

- First, let's complete Gibbs sampling with 10 draws
    1. we specify an initial value of $(\mu^{(1)}, \tau^{(1)}) = (1,1)$ to start our chain
    2. Given $\tau^{(1)} = 1$, plug in this value to $P( \mu \mid \tau, Y) \propto N(\frac{ \sum_{i=1}^{100} y_i}{1 + 100 },\frac{1}{1+100})$, now **we draw 1 sample of $\mu$, $\mu^{(2)}$ from $P( \mu \mid \tau, Y)$**
    3. Given $\mu^{(1)} = 1$ plug in this value to $P( \tau \mid \mu, Y) \propto Gamma(1 + \frac{100}{2}, 1+\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{100} (y_i-1)^2}{2})$, now **we draw 1 sample of $\tau$, $\tau{(2)}$ from $P( \tau \mid \mu, Y)$**
    4. we repeat sample 2 and 3 and construct a posterior set of $(\mu^{(1)}, \tau^{(1)}, \ldots, (\mu^{(10)}, \tau^{(10)}))$

**Summary**

- OpenBUGS, WinBUGS, and JAGS use Gibbs sampling
- Gibbs sampling relies on **conditional distributions** as proposal distributions to sample each dimension the posterior distributions.
- Gibbs sampling generates a **Markov chain** of samples, each of which is correlated with nearby samples.
    - in the example here, the next draw is sampled from posterior calculated using the previous draw!
- Generally, samples from the beginning of the chain (the burn-in period) may not accurately represent the desired distribution and are usually discarded

### Metropolis algorithm

- Metropolis algorithm is an adaptation of a random walk with an acceptance/rejection rule to converge to a specified distribution

- The algorithm generally follows the following steps (following the Gibbs' example):

1. We specify an initial value of $(\mu^{(1)}, \tau^{(1)}) = (1,1)$ to start our chain

2. Sample from a proposal joint distribution values for $(\mu^{(propose)}, \tau^{(propose)})$

3. Calculate the ratio (r) of the densities

\[r = \frac{P(\mu^{(propose)}, \tau^{(propose)} \mid y)}{P(\mu^{(1)}, \tau^{(1)} \mid y)} = \frac{P(y \mid \mu^{(propose)}, \tau^{(propose)}) P(\mu^{(propose)}) P(\tau^{(propose)})}{P(y \mid \mu^{(1)}, \tau^{(1)}) P(\mu^{(1)}) P(\tau^{(1)})}\]
    - for this step, we can format the ratio in its log scale for easy calculation, log(r)! 
    
4. Sample “u” from an uniform distribution, $u \sim Unif(0,1)$

5. accept the proposed values, $(\mu^{(2)}, \tau^{(2)}) = (\mu^{(propose)}, \tau^{(propose)})$ if $u < \min(1,r)$, otherwise reject the proposed values, keep $(\mu^{(2)}, \tau^{(2)}) = (\mu^{(1)}, \tau^{(1)})$

6. repeat step 2 to 5 for multiple iterations, forming our posterior draws!


- For this demonstration, we complete 10,000 iterations with first 5000 draws as burn-in

**Summary**

- Metropolis-Hastings (MH) generalizes Metropolis algorithm to non-symmetric proposal distributions while maintaining detailed balance. 

- Metropolis algorithm requires us to specify a proposal distribution involving some tuning, this can be tricky to set-up. A "bad" tuning parameter can result in lower acceptance rate (i.e., proposed value keeps getting rejected).

- Metropolis algorithm generates a Markov chain of samples, each of which is correlated with nearby samples.
    - in the example here, the next proposed value for $\mu$ and $\sigma$ is sampled from the proposal distribution using the previous draw!

- Again, it's a good practice to discard beginning of the chain!


## MCMC diganostics - assess convergence

- What does a good Markov chain look like?
- How can we tell if our Markov chain sample produces a reasonable approximation of the posterior?
- How big should our Markov chain sample size be? How many iterations to run?

- In this section, we provide a few diagnostic rules and principles

- A good reference paper on Bayesian workflow: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.01808.pdf, [@gelman2020bayesian]

```


**1. Choose good initial values and discard early iterations**

**2. Assessing convergence in long-run**

- A commonly used numerical index in diagnosing convergence is $\hat{R}$, also
called the potential scale reduction factor, proposed by Gelman and Rubin (1992)
and later an extension for multivariate distributions by Brooks and Gelman
(1997).

- $\hat{R}$ measures the ratio of the total variability combining multiple
chains to the within-chain variability. 
    - recall in ANOVA, the $F$-ratio is a measure of
    
\[F = \frac{\text{Between-group difference} + \text{error}}{\text{error}}\]

- $\hat{R}$ has a very similar meaning conceptually, with `error` meaning the
within-chain variance. 
    - after the  chains converge, there should be no differences between the chains, and so$\hat{R}$ should be very close to 1.0. 
- It's recommended an $\hat{R}$ less than 1.1 for acceptable convergence of the Markov chains, but more recently a more stringent cutoff of 1.01 is proposed.

 
 
**Good Mixing - trace plot and auto-correlation plot**

- One thing you should look at to diagnose the convergence of a Markov chain is the trace plot. 

- Good mixing behaviour as it explores the region with most of the density smoothly and bounces from one point to another quickly. 

- Bad mixing: 
    - although in every iteration a jump is made to a new value, the jump to the new value is relatively small, so it gonna takes a long time to get from one end of the distribution to another end, 
    - and it rarely explores all regions, therefore, if you stop the chain "early", you can get a biased representation of the posterior distribution.


**Dependence of the iterations**

- Autocorrelation provides another metric by which to evaluate whether our Markov chain sufficiently mimics the behaviour of an independent sample.

- **Strong autocorrelation** or dependence is a bad thing – it goes hand in hand with small effective sample size ratios, and thus provides a warning sign that our resulting posterior approximations might be unreliable.

- Autocorrelation
    - Lag 1 autocorrelation measures the correlation between pairs of Markov chain values that are one “step” apart 
    - Lag k autocorrelation measures the correlation between pairs of Markov chain values that are k “steps” apart 
    - we can look at ACF plot for diagnostics, in R this can be examined using acf() function!

<div class="fold s">
```{r echo=T, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Gibbs example;
acf(posterior[(1000+1):length(posterior$mu),2], main=expression(paste("Gibbs example ",mu)))
acf(posterior[(1000+1):length(posterior$tau),3], main=expression(paste("Gibbs example ",tau)))


```
<div>

**Thinning**

- we can perform thinning to achieve faster convergence!
    - thinning the MCMC by keeping every kth simulation draw and discarding the rest
    - for example, thin = 5, referring to keeping the 5th, 10th, ..., draws only! If the total MCMC iteration is 2000, for thin = 5, we will end-up with a posterior sample distribution of size = 2000/5 = 400.
    
    
### Acceptance Rate

- If you're using the Metropolis/MH algorithm, you want to monitor the acceptance
rate and make sure it is within optimal range. 

- If you accept almost every time, that tells you that each time the chain only jumps a very small step (so that the acceptance ratio is close to 1 every time), which will make the algorithm slow in converging to the stationary distribution. 

- If the acceptance rate is very low, then that says that the chain got stuck to just a few locations and it takes hundreds of iterations for it to make one jump. 

- For the Metropolis/MH algorithm, an optimal acceptance rate would be something between 10% to 60%. 

### Diagnostics Using Multiple Chains

- Another important thing to check is to see the convergence with multiple chains.

- So far we've been just talking about one chain, but it is common practice to use
two or more chains (and 4 chains are generally recommended nowadays), 
    - each starting at a different, preferably more extreme, place, and see whether they explore a similar region.



## Example Bayesian modelling with brms

### Example Bayesian logistic regression model

In this example, we will conduct an analysis using a Bayesian logistic regression model. 

- Data come from a cross-sectional study of 1,225 smokers over the age of 40.

- Each participant was assessed for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and characteristics of the type of cigarette they most frequently smoke were recorded. 

- The objective of the study was to identify associations between COPD diagnosis and cigarette characteristics

We will use the following variables from this data set:

- TYPE: Type of cigarette, 1 = Menthol, 0 = Regular

- NIC: Nicotine content, in mg

- TAR: Tar content, in mg

- LEN: Length of cigarette, in mm

- FLTR: 1 = Filter, 0 = No Vlter

- copd: 1 = COPD diagnosis, 0 = no COPD diagnosis



```{r echo=F}
copd <- read.csv("data/copd.csv", header = T)
knitr::kable(head(copd))

- We fit a simple logistic regression, predicting the risk of Copd by Type of cigarette, Nicotine content, and Filter status.

- We specify uninformative prior on log.odds, $N(0,10)$

```{r echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
m1_bern <- brm(copd ~ TYPE + NIC + FLTR, 
               data = copd, 
               family = bernoulli(link = "logit"), 
               prior = c(prior(normal(0,10), class = "b"), 
                         prior(normal(0,10), class = "Intercept")),
               seed = 123, silent = 2, refresh = 0)

saveRDS(m1_bern, file="data/chp6_logistic")
```

```{r echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
m1_bern <- readRDS("data/chp6_logistic")
summary(m1_bern)

# Directly from the posterior of exp(beta):
draws_beta_TYPE <- as.matrix(m1_bern, pars = "b_TYPE")
exp_beta_TYPE <- exp(draws_beta_TYPE)
quantile(exp_beta_TYPE, probs = c(.025, 0.5, .975))
```

```{r echo = T, fig.cap="Posterior Distribution + Trace plot combining all chains", fig.align='center'}
plot(m1_bern)
```

- Good mixing from trace plot
- Rhats' are all less then 1.01, convergence!
- Other diagnostic plots below

```{r echo = T, fig.cap="Posterior density plot by chain", fig.align='center'}
mcmc_dens_overlay(m1_bern, pars = c("b_Intercept", "b_TYPE", "b_NIC", "b_FLTR"))
```

```{r echo = T, fig.cap="Rank plot of multiple chains", fig.align='center'}
mcmc_rank_hist(m1_bern, pars = c("b_Intercept", "b_TYPE", "b_NIC", "b_FLTR"))
```

```{r echo = T, fig.cap="Autocorrelation plot by chain", fig.align='center'}
mcmc_acf_bar(m1_bern, pars = c("b_Intercept", "b_TYPE", "b_NIC", "b_FLTR"))
```

After a thorough review of fundamental concepts in statistics and probability, an introduction will be given to the fundamentals of the Bayesian approach. Students will learn how to use the brms package in the R statistical software environment to carry out Bayesian analyses of data commonly seen in health sciences. Bayesian methods will be covered for binary, continuous and count outcomes in one and two samples, for logistic, linear and Poisson regression, and for meta-analysis. By the end of this course, students will: Understand what is meant by a Bayesian Analysis and how it differs from a typical analysis under the frequentist framework Understand how modern Bayesian models are fitted Understand the role of prior(s) in Bayesian analysis and how to use prior(s) Be able to fit Bayesian models to common types of study outcomes know what aspects of the Bayesian analysis are an essential part of a statistical report Have developed expertise in using the brms program within the R environment Pre-requisites HAD5316H  Biostatistics II: Advanced Techniques in Applied Regression Methods (or CHL5202H Biostatistics II) and basic programming knowledge in R or SAS.

Thomas Bayes was a Presbyterian Minister who is thought to have been born in 1701 and died 1761. Bayesian approach were never really practiced in Bayes lifetime. His work was developed and popularized by Pierre-Simon Laplace (17491827) in the early 19th century. Though Bayes developed his philosophy during the 1740s, it wasnt until the late twentieth century that this work reached a broad audience. During the more than two centuries in between, the frequentist philosophy dominated statistical research and practice. Frequentist ideas came to predominate in the 20th century as a result of the work of Fisher (1890-1962), Neyman (1894-1981) and Egon Pearson (1984-1980). Reasons why the Bayesian approach did not catch on until relatively recently: debate of Bayesian philosophy and computational power. Bayes rule by Bayes He essentially used probabilistic terms to express arguments about the uncertainty for the parameter of a binomial model Given the number of times in which an unknown event has happened and failed: Required the chance that the probability of its happening in a single trial lies somewhere between any two degrees of probability that can be named. unknown event = e.g., Bernoulli trial probability of its happening in a single trial \\(=p\\) We may know ahead of time, or not (e.g. \\(p=0.5\\) for a fair coin) The Monty Hall Problem and the Bayesian solution by Marilyn vos Savant Suppose youre on a game show, and youre given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows whats behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, Do you want to pick door No. 2? Is it to your advantage to switch your choice? From wikipedia, Vos Savants response was that the contestant should switch to the other door. Many readers of vos Savants column refused to believe switching is beneficial and rejected her explanation. After the problem appeared in Parade, approximately 10,000 readers, including nearly 1,000 with PhDs, wrote to the magazine, most of them calling vos Savant wrong (Tierney 1991). We will revisit this problem in session 2 on Probability. I provided a short R simulation below to demonstrate why the player should choose to switch door - higher chance of winning the game. Monty Hall simulation in R set.seed(890123) monty &lt;- function(switch=F) { doors &lt;- sample(c(&#39;car&#39;, &#39;goat&#39;, &#39;goat&#39;), size=3, replace = FALSE) pick &lt;- sample(1:3, size=1, replace = FALSE) #randomly pick 1 door out of the three doors; # Using logic true or false to determine a win; if (switch==T) { # if you chose to switch, you win if the car is not behind the picked door; win &lt;- ifelse(doors[pick] != &#39;car&#39;, 1, 0) } else { # if you chose not to switch, you win if the car is behind the picked door; win &lt;- ifelse(doors[pick] == &#39;car&#39;, 1, 0) } return(win) #return the winning outcome for each game; } # run the game for 1000 iterations; # and record a vector of winning status for not switch and switch; no_switch_win &lt;- sapply(1:1000, FUN=function(i) monty(switch=F)) switch_win &lt;- sapply(1:1000, FUN=function(i) monty(switch=T)) print(paste(&quot;Chance of winning if we always not switch: &quot;, sum(no_switch_win)/1000)) ## [1] &quot;Chance of winning if we always not switch: 0.37&quot; print(paste(&quot;Chance of winning if we always switch: &quot;, sum(switch_win)/1000)) ## [1] &quot;Chance of winning if we always switch: 0.668&quot; The recent rise in popularity Advances in computing Re-evaluation of subjectivity of Bayesian approach due to its use of priors Key discussion on subjectivity by Gelman (Gelman and Hennig 2017) In discussions of the foundations of statistics, objectivity and subjectivity are seen as opposites. Objectivity is typically seen as a good thing; many see it as a major requirement for good science. Bayesian statistics is often presented as being subjective because of the choice of a prior distribution. It has been argued that the subjectiveobjective distinction is meaningless because all statistical methods, Bayesian or otherwise, require subjective choices, but the choice of prior distribution is sometimes held to be particularly subjective because, unlike the data model, it cannot be determined even in the asymptotic limit. 1.3.2 History of this course Prof. George Tomlinson created this course back in 2004 He taught this course from 2004 to 2017 and again from 2020 to 2021. Prof. Nicholas Mitsakakis taught it in 2019. This is my first time teaching this course. We are making history together =) I have borrowed a lot of course materials from George. Thank you George! Dr.Sindu Johnson and Juan Pablo will be our guest lecturers this year! 1.4 Thinking like a Bayesian using the concept of probability 1.4.1 Probability is not unitary Mathematically probability is clearly defined (a quantity between 0 and 1 etc., we will talk about this in session 2) There are a few ways of interpreting probability, most notably, long run relative frequency and subjective probability. 1. Long run relative frequency The classical or frequentist way of interpreting probability is based on the proportion of times an outcome occurs in a large (i.e. approaching infinity) number of repetitions of an experiment. This view has various serious problems, including that it requires the outcome to be observable and the experiment to be indeed repeatable! 2. Subjective probability The alternative way (essentially proposed by Bayes, LaPlace, other later prominent Bayesians) is the subjective probability. It encompasses ones views, opinions or beliefs about an event or statement. This event does not have to be repeatable or the outcome observable. It is based on belief. Using this approach, we can express the uncertainty around parameters using probability distributions (e.g., beta distribution for the risk \\(\\theta\\) of death after an operation) Example from (A. A. Johnson, Ott, and Dogucu, n.d.) Different interpretation of probability/uncertainty When flipping a fair coin, we say that the probability of flipping Heads is 0.5. How do you interpret this probability? If I flip this coin over and over, roughly 50% will be Heads. Heads and Tails are equally plausible. Both a and b make sense. An election is coming up and a pollster claims that candidate A has a 0.6 probability of winning. How do you interpret this probability? If we observe the election over and over, candidate A will win roughly 60% of the time. Candidate A is much more likely to win than to lose. The pollsters calculation is wrong. Candidate A will either win or lose, thus their probability of winning can only be 0 or 1. In the coin flip example, a Bayesian would conclude that Heads and Tails are equally likely. In contrast, a frequentist would conclude that if we flip the coin over and over and over, roughly 1/2 of these flips will be Heads. 1.4.2 Bayes Rule Bayes rule specifies how a prior probability \\(P(H)\\) of event \\(H\\) is updated in response to the evidence/data \\(E\\) to obtain the posterior probability \\(P(H|E)\\). \\[ P(H|E) = \\frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \\propto P(E|H)P(H) \\] Event \\(H\\) represents a particular hypothesis1 (or model or parameter) Event \\(E\\) represents observed evidence (or data or information) \\(P(H)\\) is the unconditional or prior probability of \\(H\\) (prior to observing \\(E\\)) \\(P(H|E)\\) is the conditional or posterior probability of \\(H\\) after observing evidence \\(E\\). \\(P(E|H)\\) is the likelihood of evidence \\(E\\) given hypothesis (or model or parameter) \\(H\\) The symbol \\(\\propto\\) proportional to, i.e., the right hand side needs to be divided by a normalizing factor (commonly viewed as a constant under Bayesian framework). The Bayesian approach provides a probability of the hypothesis given the data/evidence, which is something generally highly desirable from a scientific perspective. 1.4.3 The Scientific Method in steps Define the question or problem Assess the currently available information decide whether it is sufficient or not 2.1 If yes: conclusions, decisions, actions 2.2 If no, proceed to step 3. Determine what additional information is needed and design a study or experiment to obtain it Carry out the study designed in step 3. Use the data obtained in step 4 to update what was previously known. Return to step 2. Bayesian Advantages: Bayesian methods are especially good in step 2 and 5 They can be used for representing well existing knowledge and also to explicitly update uncertainty using new evidence. This is a done in a coherent, natural way. The ELISA test for HIV was widely used in the mid-1990s for screening blood donations. As with most medical diagnostic tests, the ELISA test is not perfect. If a person actually carries the HIV virus, experts estimate that this test gives a positive result 97.7% of the time. (This number is called the sensitivity of the test.) If a person does not carry the HIV virus, ELISA gives a negative (correct) result 92.6% of the time (the specificity of the test). Assume the estimated HIV prevalence at the time was 0.5% of (the prior base rate). Given a randomly selected individual tested positive; we are interested in the conditional probability that the person actually carries the virus. Suppose a randomly selected individual tested positive: If we know the likelihood of getting a positive test if HIV is truly present, \\(P(T^+ \\mid D^+) = 0.977\\), and the likelihood of getting a positive test if HIV is not present, \\(P(T^+ \\mid D^-) = 1 - 0.926 = 0.074\\), Using the Bayes Rule, we can obtain the posterior probability of the disease given the positive test result, \\[\\begin{aligned} P(D^+ \\mid T^+) &amp; = \\frac{P(T^+ \\mid D^+)P(D^+)}{P(T^+)} \\\\ &amp; = P(T^+ \\mid D^+) \\frac{P(D^+)}{P(T^+)}\\\\ \\Bigg( \\begin{matrix} \\text{Probability of} \\\\ \\text{HIV given} \\\\ \\text{a positive} \\\\ \\text{test} \\end{matrix} \\Bigg) &amp; = \\Bigg(\\begin{matrix} \\text{Probability of} \\\\ \\text{a positive} \\\\ \\text{test among} \\\\ \\text{HIV patients} \\end{matrix} \\Bigg) \\times \\frac{\\text{Probability of having HIV}}{\\text{Probability of a positive test}} \\\\ &amp; \\propto \\Bigg(\\begin{matrix} \\text{Probability of} \\\\ \\text{a positive} \\\\ \\text{test among} \\\\ \\text{HIV patients} \\end{matrix} \\Bigg) \\times \\text{Probability of having HIV} \\end{aligned}\\] We can see here the posterior probability is an updated belief! To summarize conceptually we have some belief about the state of the world, expressed as a mathematical model (such as the linear model used in regression). The Bayesian approach provides an updated belief as a weighted combination of prior beliefs regarding that state and the currently available evidence, with the possibility of the current evidence overwhelming prior beliefs, or prior beliefs remaining largely intact in the face of scant evidence. \\[ \\text{updated belief} = \\text{current evidence} \\times \\text{prior belief or evidence} \\] References "],["lab1-getting-started-with-r-rstudio.html", "Lab1 Getting started with R &amp; RStudio 1.5 R and RStudio Installation 1.6 R Packages 1.7 Working in RStudio 1.8 Basic R (a crash introduction)", " Lab1 Getting started with R &amp; RStudio Successfully install R and RStudio Install tidyverse and brms Try out some base R code Play with data frame and produce some summary statistics Learn about Rmarkdown with live demo by Juan Pablo 1.5 R and RStudio Installation R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics (https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html). Many users of R like a tool called RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/). This software is what is called an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R. It has several nice features, including docked windows for your console and syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting and workspace management. 1.5.1 Windows operating system install R, https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/ install RStudio, https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download YouTube Instruction 1.5.2 macOS operating system install R, https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/ install RStudio, https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download (select macOS 10.14+ option) YouTube Instruction 1.6 R Packages Packages are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include reusable R functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data.(Wickham 2015) To load the functions in a given package, we first have to install the package. We do this using the install.packages() function. Run the line of code that installs the tidyverse package below by removing the # at the start of the second line to uncomment the code. R will install the package to a default directory on your computer. If any dialogue box prompts you to set up a personal library instead, click yes. Once we have the package installed, we must load the functions from this library so we can use them within R. # install.packages(tidyverse, dependencies = T) #uncomment this line if you haven&#39;t installed this package; library(tidyverse) # load package library The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures (https://www.tidyverse.org/). The core packages are ggplot2 (data visualization), dplyr(dataframe manipulation), tidyr(data reshaping), readr(reading datasets), purrr (function and iterations) and tibble(dataframe). 1.6.1 Bayesian Analysis in R using brms package The course will mainly use the brms package in R(Bürkner 2017), which offers a standard R-modelling type interface to the underlying computing engine Stan. Direct use of Stan is not ideal for teaching Bayesian methods. The brms package automatically writes Stan code that can be viewed and edited, so after learning brms, the enterprising student may want to use this Stan code as a steppingstone toward programming directly in Stan. The brms package can be installed and loaded in the same way as any other R package, in this case by typing the following commands in R: #uncomment this line if you haven&#39;t installed this package; # install.packages(brms) library(brms) 1.7 Working in RStudio 1.7.1 RStudio layout When you open RStudio, your interface is made up of four panes as shown below. These can be organised via menu options View &gt; Panes &gt; RStudio layout We can run code in the console at the prompt where R will evaluate it and print the results. However, the best practice is to write your code in a new script file so it can be saved, edited, and reproduced. To open a new script, we select File &gt; New File &gt; R Script. To run code that was written in the script file, you can highlight the code lines you wish be evaluated and press CTRL-Enter (windows) or Cmd+Return (Mac). Additionally, You can comment or uncomment script lines by pressing Ctrl+Shift+C (windows) or Cmd+Shift+C (Mac). The comment operator in R is #. You can find more RStuio default keyboard shortcuts here. In our first tutorial, we will also introduce Rmarkdown, a R version of the markdown file editor that can write and output document in html, word, or pdf format that contents not only the programming code but also any evaluation outputs and graphs. To read more about Rmarkdown, please visit https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html. 1.7.2 Customization You can customize your RStudio session under the Options dialog Tools &gt; Global Options menu (or RStudio &gt; Preferences on a Mac). A list of customization categories can be found here, https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200549016-Customizing-RStudio. For example, its popular to change RStudio appearance and themes (e.g., mordern, sky, dark, and classic). 1.7.3 Working directory The working directory is the default location where R will look for files you want to load and where it will put any files you save. You can use function getwd() to display your current working directory and use function setwd() to set your workding directory to a new folder on your computer. One of the great things about using RStudio Projects is that when you open a project it will automatically set your working directory to the appropriate location. getwd() #show my current working directory; ## [1] &quot;D:/GitHub/bayes_bookdown&quot; 1.7.4 Getting help with R The help section of R is extremely useful if you need more information about the packages and functions that you are currently loaded. You can initiate R help using the help function help() or ?, the help operator. help(brms) 1.8 Basic R (a crash introduction) A more comprehensive introduction to base R can be found at https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html. In this subsection, I will briefly outline some common R functions and commands for arithmetic, creating and working with object, vector, matrix, and data. This short introduction is created using the intro to R workshop notes by Prof. Kevin Thorpe as well as multiple open-source materials. Some important notes R is case sensitive. Commands are separated by a newline in the console. The # character can be used to make comments. R doesnt execute the rest of the line after the # symbol - it ignores it. Previous session commands can be accessed via the up and down arrow keys on the keyboard.

Review on random variables and common probability distributions 2.1 Probability Probability has a central place in Bayesian analysis we put a prior probability distribution on the unknowns (parameters), we model the observed data with a probability distribution (likelihood), and we combine the two into a posterior probability distribution Probability Terminology(Evans and Rosenthal 2004) Sample space This set of all possible outcomes of an experiment/trial is known as the sample space of the experiment/trial and is denoted by \\(S\\) or \\(\\Omega\\). Experiment/Trial: each occasion we observe a random phenomenon that we know what outcomes can occur, but we do not know which outcome will occur Event: Any subset of the sample space \\(S\\) is known as an event, denoted by \\(A\\). Note that, \\(A\\) is also a collection of one or more outcomes. Probability defined on events: For each event \\(A\\) of the sample space \\(S\\), \\(P(A)\\), the probability of the event \\(A\\), satisfies the following three conditions: \\(0 \\leq P(A) \\leq 1\\) \\(P(S) = 1\\) and \\(P(\\emptyset) = 0\\); \\(\\emptyset\\) denotes the empty set \\(P\\) is (countably) additive, meaning that if \\(A_1, A_2, \\ldots\\) is a finite or countable sequence of disjoint (also known as mutually exclusive events), then \\[P(A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup \\ldots ) = P(A_1)+P(A_2)+\\ldots \\] Union: Denote the event that either \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) occurs as \\(A\\cup B\\). Intersection: Denote the event that both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) occur as \\(A\\cap B\\) Complement: Denote the event that \\(A\\) does not occur as \\(\\bar{A}\\) or \\(A^{C}\\) or \\(A^\\prime\\) (different people use different notations) Disjoint (or mutually exclusive): Two events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are said to be disjoint if the occurrence of one event precludes the occurrence of the other. If two events are mutually exclusive, then \\(P(A\\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)\\) Sample Space If the experiment consists of the flipping of a coin, then \\[ S = \\{H, T\\}\\] If the experiment consists of rolling a die, then the sample space is \\[ S = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\] If the experiments consists of flipping two coins, then the sample space consists of the following four points: \\[ S = \\{(H,H), (H,T), (T,H), (T,T)\\}\\] Event In Example (1), if E = {H}, then E is the event that a head appears on the flip of the coin. Similarly, if \\(E = \\{T \\}\\), then \\(E\\) would be the event that a tail appears In Example (2), if \\(E = \\{1\\}\\), then \\(E\\) is the event that one appears on the roll of the die. If \\(E = \\{2, 4, 6\\}\\), then \\(E\\) would be the event that an even number appears on the roll. In Example (3), if \\(E = \\{(H, H), (H, T )\\}\\), then \\(E\\) is the event that a head appears on the first coin. Probability of an event. Let \\(R\\) be the sum of two standard dice. Suppose we are interested in \\(P(R \\le 4)\\). Notice that the pair of dice can fall 36 different ways (6 ways for the first die and six for the second results in 6x6 possible outcomes, and each way has equal probability \\(1/36\\). \\[\\begin{aligned} P(R \\le 4 ) &amp;= P(R=2)+P(R=3)+P(R=4) \\\\ &amp;= P(\\left\\{ 1,1\\right\\} )+P(\\left\\{ 1,2\\right\\} \\mathrm{\\textrm{ or }}\\left\\{ 2,1\\right\\} )+P(\\{1,3\\}\\textrm{ or }\\{2,2\\}\\textrm{ or }\\{3,1\\}) \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{36}+\\frac{2}{36}+\\frac{3}{36} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{6}{36} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{6} \\end{aligned}\\] 2.1.1 Venn Diagrams Venn diagrams provide a very useful graphical method for depicting the sample space S and subsets of it. Figure taken from (Cardinal 2019). Figure 2.1: Venn Diagram for two events Venn Diagram for two disjoint events How would you draw this venn diagram? Label sub-regions in a Venn Diagram for three events Using set theory, how would you write out areas a, d, and f ? A &lt;- c(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;, &quot;d&quot;,&quot;e&quot;) B &lt;- c(&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;,&quot;f&quot;) C &lt;- c(&quot;d&quot;,&quot;e&quot;,&quot;f&quot;,&quot;g&quot;) x &lt;- list(A=A , B=B , C=C) v0 &lt;- venn.diagram( x, filename=NULL, fill = c(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;green&quot;), alpha = 0.50, col = &quot;transparent&quot;) overlaps &lt;- calculate.overlap(x) # extract indexes of overlaps from list names indx &lt;- as.numeric(substr(names(overlaps),2,2)) # labels start at position 7 in the list for Venn&#39;s with 3 circles for (i in 1:length(overlaps)){ v0[[6 + indx[i] ]]$label &lt;- paste(overlaps[[i]], collapse = &quot;\\n&quot;) } grid.draw(v0) 2.1.2 Probability Rules General Addition Rule: \\(P(A\\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\\cap B)\\) The reason behind this fact is that if there is if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are not disjoint, then some area is added twice when we calculate \\(P\\left(A\\right)+P\\left(B\\right)\\). To account for this, we simply subtract off the area that was double counted. If \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are disjoint, \\(P(A\\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)\\). Complement Rule: \\(P(A)+P(A^c)=1\\) This rule follows from the partitioning of the set of all events (\\(S\\)) into two disjoint sets, \\(A\\) and \\(A^c\\). We learned above that \\(A \\cup A^c = S\\) and that \\(P(S) = 1\\). Combining those statements, we obtain the complement rule. Completeness Rule: \\(P(A)=P(A\\cap B)+P(A\\cap B^c)\\) This identity is just breaking the event \\(A\\) into two disjoint pieces. Law of total probability (unconditioned version): Let \\(A_1, A_2, \\ldots\\) be events that form a partition of the sample space \\(S\\), Let \\(B\\) be any event. Then, \\[P(B) = P(A_1 \\cap B) + P(A_2 \\cap B) + \\ldots. \\] This law is key in deriving the marginal event probability in Bayes rule. Recall the HIV example from session 1, we have \\(P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap D^+)+P(T^+ \\cap D^-)\\). Figure 2.2: Demonstrate Law of total probabiliy using Venn Diagram Law of Total Probability Suppose I know that whenever it rains there is 10% chance of being late at work, while the chance is only 1% if it does not rain. Suppose that there is 30% chance of raining tomorrow; what is the chance of being late at work? Denote with event \\(A\\) as I will be late to work tomorrow and event \\(B\\) as It is going to rain tomorrow \\[\\begin{aligned} P(A) &amp;= P(A\\mid B)P(B) + P(A \\mid B^c) P(B^c) \\\\ &amp;= 0.1\\times 0.3+0.01\\times 0.7=0.037 \\end{aligned}\\] Conditional Probability: The probability of even \\(A\\) occurring under the restriction that \\(B\\) is true is called the conditional probability of \\(A\\) given \\(B\\). Denoted as \\(P(A|B)\\). In general we define conditional probability (assuming \\(P(B) \\ne 0\\)) as \\[P(A|B)=\\frac{P(A\\cap B)}{P(B)}\\] which can also be rearranged to show \\[\\begin{aligned} P(A\\cap B) &amp;= P(A\\,|\\,B)\\,P(B) \\\\ &amp;= P(B\\,|\\,A)\\,P(A) \\end{aligned}\\] Because the order doesnt matter and \\(P\\left(A\\cap B\\right)=P\\left(B\\cap A\\right)\\). \\(P(A|B) = 1\\) means that the event \\(B\\) implies the event \\(A\\). \\(P(A|B) = 0\\) means that the event \\(B\\) excludes the possibility of event \\(A\\). Independent: Two events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are said to be independent if \\(P(A\\cap B)=P(A)P(B)\\). What independence is saying that knowing the outcome of event \\(A\\) doesnt give you any information about the outcome of event \\(B\\). If \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are independent events, then \\(P(A|B) = P(A)\\) and \\(P(B|A) = P(B)\\). In simple random sampling, we assume that any two samples are independent. In cluster sampling, we assume that samples within a cluster are not independent, but clusters are independent of each other. Assumptions of independence and non-independence in statistical modelling are important. In linear regression, for example, correct standard error estimates rely on independence amongst observations. In analysis of clustered data, non-independence means that standard regression techniques are problematic. Bayes Rule: This arises naturally from the rule on conditional probability. Since the order does not matter in \\(A \\cap B\\), we can rewrite the equation: \\[\\begin{aligned} P(A\\mid B) &amp;= \\frac{P(A \\cap B) }{P(B)}\\\\ &amp;= \\frac{P(B \\cap A)}{P(B)}\\\\ &amp;= \\frac{P(B\\mid A)P(A) }{P(B)}\\\\ &amp;= \\frac{P(B\\mid A)P(A) }{P(B \\cap A) + P(B \\cap A^C)}\\\\ &amp;= \\frac{P(B\\mid A)P(A) }{P(B\\mid A)P(A) + P(B\\mid A^C)P(A^C)} \\end{aligned}\\] 2.1.3 How to define and assign probabilities in general? Frequency-type (Empirical Probability): based on the idea of frequency or long-run frequency of an event. Observe sequence of coin tosses (trials) and the count number of times of event \\(A=\\{H\\}\\). The relative frequency of \\(A\\) is given as, \\[ P(A) = \\frac{\\text{Number of times A occurs}}{\\text{Total number of trials}}. \\] Trials are independent. Relative frequency is unpredictable in short-term, but in long-run its predicable. Let \\(n\\) be the total number of trials and \\(m\\) be number of heads, then we have \\[ P(A) = \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{m}{n}.\\] Theoretical Probability: Sometimes \\(P(A)\\) can be deduced from mathematical model using uniform probability property on finite spaces. If the sample space S is finite, then one possible probability measure on \\(S\\) is the uniform probability measure, which assigns probability \\(1/|S|\\), equal probability to each outcome. Here |S| is the number of elements in the sample space \\(S\\). By additivity, it then follows that for any event \\(A\\) we have, \\[ P(A) = \\frac{|A|}{|S|} = \\frac{\\text{Number of outcomes in S that satisfy A}}{\\text{Total number of outcomes in S} } \\] Long-term frequency It is natural to think of large sequences of similar events defining frequency-type probability if we allow the number of trials to be indefinitely large. n = 1000 pHeads =0.5 set.seed(123) flipSequence = sample( x=c(0,1),prob = c(1-pHeads,pHeads),size=n,replace=T) r = cumsum(flipSequence) n= 1:n runProp = r/n flip_data &lt;- data.frame(run=1:1000,prop=runProp) ggplot(flip_data,aes(x=run,y=prop,frame=run)) + geom_path()+ xlim(1,1000)+ylim(0.0,1.0)+ geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5)+ ylab(&quot;Proportion of Heads&quot;)+ xlab(&quot;Number of Flips&quot;)+ theme_bw() Figure 2.3: Demonstrate law of large number with the coin tossing example Belief-type (Subjective Probability): based on the idea of degree of belief (weight of evidence) about an event where the scale is anchored at certain (=1) and impossible (=0). Subjective Probability Consider these events We will have more than 100cm of snow this winter. An asteroid is responsible for the extinction of the dinosaurs Mammography reduces the rate of death from breast cancer in women over 50 by more than 10% The 70 year old man in your office, just diagnosed with lung cancer, will live at least 5 years Can you think of them in terms of long-run frequencies? We cannot always think in terms of long-run frequencies Also, we may not care about long-run frequencies How are they relevant to this patient, this hypothesis? Even where long-run frequency could apply, often there is no such data available However, opinions are formed and beliefs exist Which probability to use? For inference, the Bayesian approach relies mainly on the belief interpretation of probability. The laws of probability can be derived from some basic axioms that do not rely on long-run frequencies. The Monty Hall Problem Revisit Suppose youre on a game show, and youre given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows whats behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, Do you want to pick door No. 2? Is it to your advantage to switch your choice? Before any door is picked, we assume all three doors are equal likely to have a car behind it (prior probability of 1/3). Without loss of generality, let assume we pick door 1 and Monty opens door 2 (goat behind). \\(P( \\text{door 1 has car}) = P( \\text{door 2 has car}) = P( \\text{door 3 has car)} = \\frac{1}{3}\\) \\(P( \\text{Monty opens door 2} \\mid \\text{door 1 has car} ) = \\frac{1}{2}\\) \\(P( \\text{Monty opens door 2} \\mid \\text{door 2 has car} ) = 0\\) \\(P( \\text{Monty opens door 2} \\mid \\text{door 3 has car} ) = 1\\) We want to know these two probabilities: \\(P( \\text{door 1 has car} \\mid \\text{Monty opens door 2} )\\) and \\(P( \\text{door 3 has car} \\mid \\text{Monty opens door 2} )\\). Simplify notations, we have \\[\\begin{aligned} &amp; P( D_1 = \\text{car} \\mid \\text{open } D_2 ) \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{P( \\text{open } D_2 \\mid D_1 = \\text{car} )P(D_1 = \\text{car})}{P(\\text{open } D_2)} \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{P( \\text{open } D_2 \\mid D_1 = \\text{car} )P(D_1 = \\text{car})}{P( \\text{open } D_2 \\mid D_1 = \\text{car} )P(D_1 = \\text{car}) + P(\\text{open } D_2 \\mid D_3 = \\text{car})P(D_3 = \\text{car})} \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3}}{\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3} + 1 \\times \\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\end{aligned}\\] \\[\\begin{aligned} &amp; P( D_3 = \\text{car} \\mid \\text{open } D_2 ) \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{P( \\text{open } D_2 \\mid D_3 = \\text{car} )P(D_3 = \\text{car})}{P(\\text{open } D_2)} \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{P( \\text{open } D_2 \\mid D_3 = \\text{car} )P(D_3 = \\text{car})}{P( \\text{open } D_2 \\mid D_3 = \\text{car} )P(D_3 = \\text{car}) + P(\\text{open } D_2 \\mid D_1 = \\text{car})P(D_1 = \\text{car})} \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{ 1 \\times \\frac{1}{3}}{ 1 \\times \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{2}{3} \\end{aligned}\\] Given we pick door 1 and Monty opens door 2 (goat behind), the probability of the car behind door 1 is 1/3 while the probability of the car behind door 3 is 2/3. Therefore, we should switch to door 3 for a better chance of winning. The ELISA test Problem Revisit The ELISA test for HIV was widely used in the mid-1990s for screening blood donations. As with most medical diagnostic tests, the ELISA test is not perfect. If a person actually carries the HIV virus, experts estimate that this test gives a positive result 97.7% of the time. (This number is called the sensitivity of the test.) If a person does not carry the HIV virus, ELISA gives a negative (correct) result 92.6% of the time (the specificity of the test). Assume the estimated HIV prevalence at the time was 0.5% of (the prior base rate). Suppose a randomly selected individual tested positive, please calculate \\(P(D^+ \\mid T^+)\\) and \\(P(D^- \\mid T^-)\\). \\[\\begin{aligned} P(D^+ \\mid T^+) &amp; = \\frac{P(D^+ \\text{and } T^+)}{P(T^+)}\\\\ &amp; = \\frac{\\text{Chance of HIV positive and test positive}}{\\text{Chance of test positive}}\\\\ &amp; = \\frac{P(T^+ \\mid D^+)P(D^+)}{P(T^+)} \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{P(T^+ \\mid D^+)P(D^+)}{P(T^+ \\mid D^+)P(D^+) + P(T^+ \\mid D^-)P(D^-)} \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{0.977 \\times 0.005}{0.977 \\times 0.005 + 0.074 \\times 0.995} = \\frac{0.0049}{0.0785} = 0.0622 \\end{aligned}\\] Demonstrate calculation in R hypothesis = c(&quot;Carries HIV&quot;, &quot;Does not carry HIV&quot;) prior = c(0.005, 1 - 0.005) likelihood = c(0.977, 1 - 0.926) # given positive test product = prior * likelihood posterior = product / sum(product) bayes_table = data.frame(hypothesis, prior, likelihood, product, posterior) %&gt;% add_row(hypothesis = &quot;Sum&quot;, prior = sum(prior), likelihood = NA, product = sum(product), posterior = sum(posterior)) knitr::kable(bayes_table, digits = 4, align = &#39;r&#39;) hypothesis prior likelihood product posterior Carries HIV 0.005 0.977 0.0049 0.0622 Does not carry HIV 0.995 0.074 0.0736 0.9378 Sum 1.000 NA 0.0785 1.0000 2.2 Probability Distributions Random variables are used to describe events and their probability. The formal definition just means that a random variable describes how numbers are attached to each possible elementary outcome. Random variables can be divided into two types: Continuous Random Variables: the variable takes on numerical values and could, in principle, take any of an uncountable number of values. These typically have values that cannot be counted, e.g. age, height, blood pressure, etc. Discrete Random Variables: the variable takes on one of small set of values (or only a countable number of outcomes). The value of a particular measurement can be thought of as being determined by chance, even though there may be no true randomness a patients survival time after surgery for prostate cancer distance an elderly person walks in 6 minutes known factors may give an expected value and variance unknown (or unknowable factors) lead to uncertainty given this mean the component that appears random to the analyst is modelled as being random. Probability distributions The true distribution of most random variables (outcomes) is not known. It is convenient to approximate the distribution by a function (probability distribution) with a small number of parameters. We focus our attention on these parameters, rather than the whole distribution. Statistical modelling that is based on estimating the parameters of distributions is called parametric modelling. All the Bayesian models we will look at are parametric models. All models are wrong but some are useful.

The area under the curve between any two x-values is the probability that a randomly sampled value will fall in that range The area under the whole curve is equal to the total probability, i.e. equal to 1 From histograms to PDFs With a large enough sample, and narrow enough intervals, histogram starts to look smooth. The relative heights of the histogram at each blood pressure value tell us how likely these values are. For example, near 120 mm Hg there are about 800 people in each 5 mm interval. As the width of the interval approaches zero, the probability of being in that interval approaches zero. e.g. The event that BP is exactly 129 has zero probability, with \\[P(BP = 129) \\approx P(128.99999 &lt; BP &lt; 129.00001) \\approx 0.\\] For a continuous random variable, we describe the shape of the distribution with a smooth curve (pdf) instead of a histogram. The relative height of the curve at any two points indicates the relative likelihood of the two values. The height is not a probability. The area under the curve between any two points is the probability that a randomly sampled value will fall in that range. e.g., the shaded area represent = 0.5. In fact, the probability of a BP from this population being between 112 and 145 is 0.5. Useful Probability Distributions Discrete random variables and distributions means that the random variable can take on only a countable number of values. We will describe these distributions using probability mass function. Binomial Multinomial Poisson Negative binomial Continuous random variables and distributions: We will describe these distributions using probability density function. Uniform Normal Beta Gamma The expectation for discrete distributions \\[E[X]= \\sum_{x=0}^{n}x\\,P(X=x) \\] and the variance for discrete distributions \\[V[X]=\\sum_{x=0}^{n}\\left(x-E\\left[X\\right]\\right)^{2}\\,P(X=x) \\] The expectation for continuous distributions \\[E[X]= \\int_{a}^{b}x\\,f(x) dx\\] and the variance for continuous distributions \\[V[X]= E[(X-E(X))^2] = E(X^2) - E(X)^2\\] and \\[E[X^2]= \\int_{a}^{b}x^2\\,f(x) dx\\] 2.2.2 Discrete Distributions 2.2.2.1 Bernoulli Distribution A single binary outcome Y can be represented as taking on the values 0 or 1. Of course, this could be success/failure, return/did not return, etc. There is a single parameter - the probability that the variable takes on the value 1 (probability of success), denoted as \\(p\\). \\(P(Y=1) = p\\) and \\(P(Y=0) = 1 - p\\) The probability mass function is \\[P(Y=y) = p^y (1-p)^{1-y}, y \\in \\{0,1 \\}\\] Daniel Bernoulli FRS (1700-1782) was a Swiss mathematician and physicist and was one of the many prominent mathematicians in the Bernoulli family from Basel. 2.2.2.2 Binomial Distribution One of the most important discrete distribution used in statistics is the binomial distribution. This is the distribution which counts the number of heads in \\(n\\) independent coin tosses where each individual coin toss has the probability \\(p\\) of being a head. The same distribution is useful when not just in tossing coins, for example, when taking random samples from a disease cohort and interested in the number of patients in this sample that received surgery. A binomial experiment is one that: Experiment consists of \\(n\\) identical trials. Each trial results in one of two outcomes (Heads/Tails, presence/absence). will be labelled a success and the other a failure. The probability of success on a single trial is equal to \\(p\\) and remains the same from trial to trial. The trials are independent (this is implied from property 3). The random variable \\(Y\\) is the number of successes observed during \\(n\\) trials. The Binomial Probability Mass Function The probability mass function for the binomial distribution is \\[ P(Y=y) = \\binom{n}{y} p^y(1-p)^{n-y}, \\ \\text{for } y=0,\\ldots,n \\] where \\(n\\) is a positive integer and \\(p\\) is a probability between 0 and 1. This probability mass function uses the expression \\(\\binom{n}{y}\\), called a binomial coefficient \\[ \\binom{n}{y} = \\frac{n!}{y!(n-y)!} \\] which counts the number of ways to choose \\(x\\) things from \\(n\\). The mean of the binomial distribution is \\(E(Y) = np\\) and the variance is \\(Var(Y) = np(1-p)\\). dist &lt;- data.frame( x=0:10 ) %&gt;% mutate(probability = dbinom(x, size=10, prob=0.5)) ggplot(dist, aes(x=x)) + geom_point(aes(y=probability)) + geom_linerange(aes(ymax=probability, ymin=0)) + scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,10,1))+ ggtitle(&#39;Binomial distribution: n=10, p=0.5&#39;) + theme_bw() We can use R to calculate binomial probabilities. In general, for any distribution, the d-function gives the distribution function (pmf or pdf). \\(P( x = 5 | n=10, p=0.8 ) = 0.02642412\\) from dbinom(5, size=10, prob=0.8) and \\(P( x = 8 | n=10, p=0.8 )=0.3019899\\) from dbinom(8, size=10, prob=0.8). 2.2.2.3 Multinomial Distribution If a random variable \\(Y\\) can take on one of \\(K\\) categories and the probability of each category \\(k\\) is given by the set of probabilities \\(p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_K\\) and \\(\\sum_{k=1}^K p_k = 1\\). The probability that the single observation \\(Y\\) is in category \\(k\\) is given by \\(P(Y=k) = p_k\\). With \\(n\\) observations, we are interested in the number that fall into each of the \\(k\\) categories. The random variable \\(Y\\), thus follows a multinomial distribution. The multinomial Probability Mass Function The probability mass function for the multinomial distribution is \\[P(y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_K) = \\frac{n! }{y_1!, y_2!, \\ldots, y_K!} p_1^{y_1} p_2^{y_2} \\cdots p_K^{y_K}, y_j= 0, \\ldots, K, j = 1, \\ldots, K \\ and \\ \\sum y_j = K. \\] This is a useful distribution to use as a starting point for modelling categorical data with a relatively small number (&gt; 2) of possible values. Example Suppose our outcome (random variable) is severity level This can take on the values (1) none/mild ; (2) moderate; and (3) severe. Let the probabilities for the three categories be \\(p_1\\),\\(p_2\\), and \\(p_3\\). \\[P(Y = 1) = p_1; \\ P(Y = 2) = p_2;\\ P(Y = 3) = p_3 = 1 - (p_1+p_2);\\] if we observe 100 subjects, with 20, 65 and 15 in the three categories, \\[ P(20,65,15) = \\frac{100! }{20! 65!15!} p_1^{20} p_2^{65} p_3^{16}\\] if we assume \\(p_1=0.2\\), \\(p_2 = 0.6\\), \\(p_3 = 0.2\\), the above probability is 0.004644407 from R with dmultinom(x=c(20,65,15),prob=c(0.2,0.6,0.2)). 2.2.2.4 Poisson Distribution A commonly used distribution for count data is the Poisson. e.g., number of patients arriving at ER over a 12 hr interval. The following conditions apply: Two or more events do not occur at precisely the same time or in the same space The occurrence of an event in a given period of time or region of space is independent of the occurrence of the event in a non overlapping period or region. The expected number of events during one period , \\(\\lambda\\), is the same in all periods or regions of the same size. Assuming that these conditions hold for some count variable \\(Y\\), the the probability mass function is given by \\[P(Y=y)=\\frac{\\lambda^{y}e^{-\\lambda}}{y!}, y = 0, 1, \\ldots\\] where \\(\\lambda\\) is the expected number of events over 1 unit of time or space and \\(e\\) is the eulers number \\(2.718281828\\dots\\). \\[E[Y] = \\lambda\\] \\[Var[Y] = \\lambda\\] Example: Suppose we are interested in the population size of small mammals in a region. Let \\(Y\\) be the number of small mammals caught in a large trap over a 12 hour period. Finally, suppose that \\(Y\\sim Poisson(\\lambda=2.3)\\). What is the probability of finding exactly 4 critters in our trap? \\[P(Y=4) = \\frac{2.3^{4}\\,e^{-2.3}}{4!} = 0.1169\\] What about the probability of finding at most 4? \\[\\begin{aligned} P(Y\\le4) &amp;= P(Y=0)+P(Y=1)+P(Y=2)+P(Y=3)+P(Y=4) \\\\ &amp;= 0.1003+0.2306+0.2652+0.2033+0.1169 \\\\ &amp;= 0.9163 \\end{aligned}\\] What about the probability of finding 5 or more? \\[P(Y\\ge5) = 1-P(Y\\le4) = 1-0.9163 = 0.0837\\] These calculations can be done using the distribution function (d-function) for the Poisson and the cumulative distribution function (p-function). e.g. \\(P(Y=4\\mid \\lambda = 2.3\\) can be obtained using dpois(4, lambda=2.3) and \\(P(Y \\leq 4\\mid \\lambda = 2.3\\) can be obtained using ppois(4, lambda=2.3). 2.2.2.5 Negative Binomial Distribution If \\(Y\\) is the count of independent Bernoulli trials required to achieve the \\(r\\)th successful trial (\\(k\\) failures) when the probability of success is \\(p\\). \\(Y \\sim NB(r, p)\\) and the probability mass function is \\[ f(Y = k) = \\frac{\\Gamma(k+r)}{k! \\Gamma(r)} (1-p)^y (p)^{r}, \\ \\text{for } y=0,1,\\ldots \\] \\(E(Y) = \\frac{pr}{1-p}\\) and \\(V(Y) = \\frac{pr}{(1-p)^2}\\) Connection between Poisson and Negative Binomial. Let \\(\\lambda = E(Y) = \\frac{pr}{1-p}\\), we thus have \\(p=\\frac{\\lambda}{r+\\lambda}\\) and \\(V(Y) = \\lambda(1 + \\frac{\\lambda}{r}) &gt; \\lambda\\). The variance of the NB is greater than its mean, where as the variance of Poisson equals to its mean! When we fit a Poisson regression and encounter over-dispersion - the observed variance of the data is greater than the variance of the Poisson model, we can fit a Negative Binomial regression instead! 2.2.3 Continous Distributions 2.2.3.1 Uniform Distributions Suppose you wish to draw a random number number between 0 and 1 and any two intervals of equal size should have the same probability of the value being in them. This random variable is said to have a Uniform(0,1) distribution. The uniform distribution has two parameter, a lower bound (a) and an upper bound (b) The pdf is a constant - no value is any more likely than any other \\[p(x \\mid a, b) = \\frac{1}{b-a}, b&gt;a, a \\leq x \\leq b\\] Mean = \\(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\) and variance = \\(\\frac{(b-a)^2}{12}\\) 2.2.3.2 Normal Distributions Undoubtedly the most important distribution in statistics is the normal distribution. Normal Distributions has two parameters: mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\). Its probability density function is given by \\[f(x)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma}\\exp\\left[-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right]\\] where \\(\\exp[y]\\) is the exponential function \\(e^{y}\\). We could slightly rearrange the function to \\[f(x)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma}\\exp\\left[-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)^{2}\\right]\\] and see this distribution is defined by its expectation \\(E[X]=\\mu\\) and its variance \\(Var[X]=\\sigma^{2}\\). Example: It is known that the heights of adult males in the US is approximately normal with a mean of 5 feet 10 inches (\\(\\mu=70\\) inches) and a standard deviation of \\(\\sigma=3\\) inches. I am 5 feet 4 inches (64 inches). What proportion of the adult male population is shorter than me? Using R you can easily find this probability is 0.02275013 using pnorm(64, mean=70, sd=3). 2.2.3.3 Beta Distributions Beta distribution is denoted as \\(Beta(\\alpha, \\beta)\\), with \\(\\alpha&gt;0\\) (shape parameter 1) and \\(\\beta&gt;0\\) (shape parameter 2) We can interpret \\(\\alpha\\) as the number of pseudo events and \\(\\beta\\) as the number of pseudo non-events, so that \\(\\alpha + \\beta\\) is the pseudo sample size If the random variable follows a beta distribution, its value is bounded between 0 and 1, making this distribution a candidate distribution to model proportion. e.g. proportion of patients received surgery. mean = \\(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta} = \\frac{\\text(events)}{\\text(sample size)} = p\\) variance = \\[ \\frac{\\alpha\\beta}{(\\alpha+\\beta)^2(\\alpha+\\beta+1)} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta} \\times \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta} \\times \\frac{1}{\\alpha+\\beta+1} = p(1-p)\\frac{1}{\\text(sample size)+1} \\] The probability density function \\[ f(x) = \\frac{\\Gamma(\\alpha + \\beta)}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)\\Gamma(\\beta)} x^{\\alpha - 1} (1-x)^{\\beta - 1}, 0 \\leq x \\leq 1.\\] where \\[ B(\\alpha, \\beta) = \\frac{\\Gamma(\\alpha)\\Gamma(\\beta)}{\\Gamma(\\alpha + \\beta)}\\] and \\(\\Gamma()\\) is called the gamma function. 2.2.3.4 Gamma Distributions Gamma distribution is denoted as \\(Gamma(\\alpha, \\beta)\\), with \\(\\alpha&gt;0\\) (shape parameter) and \\(\\beta&gt;0\\) (rate parameter) If the random variable follows a Gamma distribution, it can have values larger than 0 mean = \\(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\) and variance = \\(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta^2}\\) The probability density function \\[f(x) = \\frac{\\beta^\\alpha}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)} x^{\\alpha - 1} e^{-\\beta x},x \\geq 0.\\] Role of these distributions All of them are potentially distributions for observed outcomes. Similar choices as in non-Bayesian modelling A select group of continuous distributions are frequently used to represent prior distributions for parameters Normal - for regression parameters Beta - for proportions, other bounded parameters Uniform - for proportions, standard deviations Gamma - for rates, variances R Session information ## R version 4.0.5 (2021-03-31) ## Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit) ## Running under: Windows 10 x64 (build 19042) ## ## Matrix products: ## ## locale: ## [1] LC_COLLATE=English_Canada.1252 LC_CTYPE=English_Canada.1252 ## [3] LC_MONETARY=English_Canada.1252 LC_NUMERIC=C ## [5] LC_TIME=English_Canada.1252 ## ## attached base packages: ## [1] grid stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods ## [8] base ## ## other attached packages: ## [1] truncnorm_1.0-8 ggpubr_0.4.0 tweenr_1.0.2 ## [4] gganimate_1.0.7 VennDiagram_1.7.1 futile.logger_1.4.3 ## [7] brms_2.16.3 Rcpp_1.0.7 forcats_0.5.1 ## [10] stringr_1.4.0 dplyr_1.0.7 purrr_0.3.4 ## [13] readr_2.1.1 tidyr_1.1.4 tibble_3.1.6 ## [16] ggplot2_3.3.5 tidyverse_1.3.1 References "],["bayes.html", "Session 3 Introduction to Bayesian inference 3.1 Classical frequentist approach 3.2 Introduction to Bayesian approach 3.3 Summary of Conjugate priors &amp; models 3.4 Why Bayesian: Statistical Estimation Revisit", " Session 3 Introduction to Bayesian inference Review of frequentist inferential approaches Introduce Bayesian inference Learn two simple Bayesian models (Beta-binomial &amp; normal-normal) Discuss practical advantages and disadvantages of Bayesian approach 3.1 Classical frequentist approach The classical (frequentist) statistical approach takes many forms, but the most wide-ranging is the likelihood-based approach This approach specifies a distributional form for data and considers the parameters of the distributions to be fixed constants to be estimated. The parameters are estimated by finding the values that maximize the likelihood (hence the name) i.e. given the observed data, and assuming they come from specific distributions, what are the parameter values for these distributions that maximize the likelihood of these data? Review of likelihood function Given a statistical model with some parameters (lets call them \\(\\theta\\)), and given a set of observed data of size \\(n\\), \\(D = \\{x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n \\}\\), the likelihood function, \\(L(\\theta, D)\\) is a function that for every value of \\(\\theta\\) is equal to the probability (mass or density) of observing \\(D\\) given \\(\\theta\\) i.e. \\(L(\\theta, D) = L_D(\\theta) = P(Data | \\theta)\\) if we assume \\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n\\) are independent and identically distributed, we can express the likelihood function as \\[ L(\\theta, D) = P(x_1 \\mid \\theta)\\times P(x_2 \\mid \\theta) \\ldots \\times P(x_n \\mid \\theta) = \\prod_{i=1}^n P(x_i\\mid \\theta).\\] Example - Bernoulli trials Suppose we want to estimate the risk of death \\(\\theta\\) after a surgery We assume that every patient has the same risk \\(\\theta\\) We collect data from 10 surgeries and we find that 3 patients died and 7 survived, What is the likelihood function for \\(\\theta\\) in this example? The distribution for each patient is \\(Bernoulli(\\theta)\\) the probability of the number of those who died out of \\(n\\) (here \\(n\\)=10) is \\(Binomial(\\theta, 10)\\) The probability mass function of the binomial is \\[p(x|\\theta, n) = {n \\choose x} \\theta^x (1-\\theta)^{n-x}\\] The likelihood function of the observed data (3 deaths out of 10) given \\(\\theta\\) is \\[ L_D(\\theta) = p(x=3| \\theta) = {10 \\choose 3} \\theta^3 (1-\\theta)^{10-3} \\propto \\theta^3 (1-\\theta)^{10-3}\\] Maximum Likelihood Estimator The value that maximizes the likelihood function is called the maximum likelihood estimator or MLE It is the most likely value for \\(\\theta\\) given the observed data In this example it is equal to \\(\\hat{\\theta}_{mle} = \\frac{x}{n} = \\frac{3}{10}=0.3\\) (the observed proportion of event), which can be obtained by taking the first derivative of the loglikelihood and calculate the value of \\(\\theta\\) that yields \\[\\begin{aligned} LogL(\\theta, D) &amp;= log({10 \\choose 3}) + 3\\ log(\\theta) + (10-3)\\ log(1- \\theta) \\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}LogL(\\theta, D) &amp; = \\frac{3}{\\theta} - \\frac{10-3}{1-p} = 0 \\\\ \\hat{\\theta}_{mle} &amp; = \\frac{3}{10}=0.3 \\end{aligned}\\] It is the most commonly method to estimate a parameter in frequentist statistics #simulating a sequence of probability representing parameter \\theta; #\\theta, probability of success, value between 0 and 1; theta &lt;- seq(0, 1, length=1000) #coding Binomial likelihood given x = 3 and n = 10; L &lt;- choose(10,3)*theta^3*(1-theta)^(10-3) #coding log Binomial likelihood given x = 3 and n = 10; logL &lt;- log(choose(10,3)) + 3*log(theta)+ (10-3)*log((1-theta)) # Ploting likelihood function d &lt;- tibble(theta=theta, L=L) p1&lt;-ggplot(data=d, aes(theta,L)) + geom_line()+ ggtitle(&quot;Binomial likelihood x = 3 and n=10&quot;) + theme_bw() # Ploting likelihood function d2 &lt;- tibble(theta=theta, logL=logL) p2&lt;-ggplot(data=d, aes(theta,logL)) + geom_line()+ ggtitle(&quot;Log Binomial likelihood x = 3 and n=10&quot;) + theme_bw() ggarrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2, nrow = 1) #negative loglikelihood function of binomial; neglogL &lt;- function(theta){-sum(dbinom(x=3, size = 10, theta, log = TRUE))} #optimize: optim(par = 0.5, fn=neglogL, method = &quot;Brent&quot;, lower = 0, upper = 1, hessian = TRUE) ## $par ## [1] 0.3 ## ## $value ## [1] 1.321151 ## ## $counts ## function gradient ## NA NA ## ## $convergence ## [1] 0 ## ## $message ## NULL ## ## $hessian ## [,1] ## [1,] 47.61985 Maximum Likelihood confidence interval MLE satisfies the following two properties called consistency and asymptotic normality. Consistency. We say that an estimate \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) is consistent if \\(\\hat{\\theta} \\rightarrow \\theta_0\\) as \\(n \\rightarrow \\infty\\), where \\(\\theta_0\\) is the true unknown parameter and \\(n\\) is sample size. Asymptotic normality \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) is asymptotic normality if \\[ \\sqrt{n} (\\hat{\\theta} - \\theta_0) \\rightarrow^d N(0, \\sigma_{\\theta_0}^2) \\] where \\(\\sigma_{\\theta_0}^2)\\) is the asymptotic variance of the estimate \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\). Asymptotic normality says that the estimator not only converges to the unknown parameter, but it converges fast enough, at a rate \\(1/\\sqrt{n}\\). Given this properties, we can use Fisher information to estimate the variance of MLE and subsequently obtaining confidence intervals. - MLE Asymptotic normality with Fisher information, \\(I(\\theta_0)\\) \\[ \\sqrt{n} (\\hat{\\theta}_{mle} - \\theta_0) \\rightarrow^d N(0, \\frac{1}{I(\\theta_0)}) \\] Fisher information is defined using the second derivative of the loglikelihood. \\[ I(\\theta) = - E[\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\theta^2} logL(x_1,\\ldots, x_n \\mid \\theta)]\\] e.g., for binomail distribution, \\(I(\\theta)=\\frac{n}{\\theta(1-\\theta)}\\), thus the 95% CI for \\(\\hat{\\theta}_{mle}\\) is \\[ \\hat{\\theta}_{mle} \\pm 1.96 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{\\theta}_{mle}(1-\\hat{\\theta}_{mle})}{n}} \\] which gives us \\(0.3 \\pm 1.96 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{0.3 \\times 0.7}{10}}\\), [0.016, 0.584].

Can you construct the 95% CI confidence interval of the MLE estimator? What is you conclusion comparing this estimator to the MLE obtain from the smaller dataset (10 surgeries, 3 patients died and 7 survived)? 3.2 Introduction to Bayesian approach 3.2.1 Review from session 1 In the Bayesian approach, everything that is not data is considered as a parameter Uncertainty about these parameters is expressed using probability distributions and probabilistic statements A prior distribution expresses what is known or believed independently of the data This prior is updated as data or new evidence is presented The posterior distribution expresses the updated belief Recall Bayes theorem Let \\(D = \\text{patient has disease}\\) and \\(Y = \\text{patient has a positive diagnostic test}\\), \\[\\begin{aligned} P(D \\mid T) &amp; = \\frac{P(T \\mid D)P(D)}{P(T)} \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{P(T \\mid D)P(D)}{P(T \\mid D)P(D) + P(T \\mid D^c)P(D^c)} \\end{aligned}\\] \\(P(T\\mid D)\\) is the likelihood of the outcome (positive test) given the unknown parameter (disease state) \\(P(D)\\) is pre-test probability (prior probability) of disease \\(P(D\\mid T)\\) is the post-test probability of disease which can be obtained by multiplying the likelihood and the pre-test probabiltiy. Here, to calculate \\(P(D\\mid T)\\) we need \\(P(D)\\)! A very sensitive test (e.g., P(TD) = 0.99) can still result in a small post-test probability if the prior probability of disease, \\(P(D)\\), is low! The Bayesian approach to estimating parameters stems from Bayes theorem for continuous variables: Let \\(\\theta\\) be the parameter of interest and \\(y\\) be the observed data, \\[\\begin{aligned} P(\\theta \\mid y) &amp; = \\frac{P(y \\mid \\theta)P(\\theta)}{P(y)} \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{\\text{likelihood of data given parameter} \\times \\text{prior}}{\\text{marginal distribution of data free of the parameter}} \\\\ &amp; \\propto \\text{likelihood}(y \\mid \\theta ) \\times \\text{prior}(\\theta) \\end{aligned}\\] \\(P(y)\\) is called a normalizing factor, its in place to ensure that \\(\\int P(\\theta \\mid y) d\\theta = 1\\), that is the posterior distribution of \\(\\theta\\) is a proper probability distribution with area under the density curve equals to 1. Its value is not of interest, unless we are comparing between data models. The essence of Bayes theorem only concerns the terms involving the parameter, \\(\\theta\\), hence \\(P(\\theta \\mid y) \\propto P(y\\mid \\theta)P(\\theta)\\). Estimating a Proportion Suppose you have observed 6 patients in a Phase I RCT on a given dose of drug, - 0 out of 6 patients have had an adverse event - decision to escalate to a higher dose if its unlikely that the current dosing results in a true proportion of adverse events above 20% (i.e., given the current data, is there sufficient evidence to infer the true proportion of adverse event is less than 20%, if so we can increase the dose level) This is a classic phase I estimate, under frequentist test (Exact Binomial Test) we have binom.test(x=0, n=6, p = 0.2, alternative = c(&quot;less&quot;), conf.level = 0.95) ## ## Exact binomial test ## ## data: 0 and 6 ## number of successes = 0, number of trials = 6, p-value = 0.2621 ## alternative hypothesis: true probability of success is less than 0.2 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.0000000 0.3930378 ## sample estimates: ## probability of success ## 0 The observed proportion \\(\\hat{\\theta}=0\\) with 95% CI: 0 - 0.39. How much evidence we have that AE rate is &lt; 20%? #suppose we observe 0 adverse event out of 14 patients; #the test results below suggest we would reject the null hypothesis; #at 0.05 alpha level and conclude the true AE rate is &lt; 20%; binom.test(x=0, n=14, p = 0.2, alternative = c(&quot;less&quot;), conf.level = 0.95) ## ## Exact binomial test ## ## data: 0 and 14 ## number of successes = 0, number of trials = 14, p-value = 0.04398 ## alternative hypothesis: true probability of success is less than 0.2 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.0000000 0.1926362 ## sample estimates: ## probability of success ## 0 What would a Bayesian do? To make probability statements about \\(\\theta\\) after observing data \\(y\\), we need a probability distribution for \\(\\theta\\) given \\(y\\) (the posterior distribution). 1.First, we need to specify a prior distribution for \\(\\theta\\), \\(P(\\theta)\\). Example 1: We might have no idea about \\(\\theta\\) other than that it lies in the interval [0,1] and thus specify a unif(0,1). Let \\(\\theta \\sim U(0,1)\\), the prior probability distribution (p.d.f) is \\[ P(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{1-0} = 1.\\] Example 2: We might have some knowledge about the range of \\(\\theta\\), say, we are believe \\(0.05&lt;\\theta&lt;0.5\\). We can have \\[ \\theta \\sim U(0.05, 0.5)\\] \\[P(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{0.5-0.05} = 2.22.\\] We assume the \\(P(y \\mid \\theta)\\) follows a binomial distribution, thus the likelihood of the observed data given \\(\\theta\\) is \\[ P(y = 0 \\mid \\theta) = {6 \\choose 0} \\theta^0 (1-\\theta)^6 = (1-\\theta)^6\\] The posterior then becomes (given example prior 1) \\[\\begin{align} P(\\theta \\mid y = 0) &amp;= \\frac{P(y = 0 \\mid \\theta) \\times P(\\theta)}{P(y=0)} \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{(1-\\theta)^6 \\times 1}{P(y=0)} \\\\ &amp; = \\text{Constant} \\times (1-\\theta)^6 \\\\ &amp; \\propto (1-\\theta)^6 \\end{align}\\] d &lt;- tibble(p_grid = seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = 1000), y = 0, n = 6) %&gt;% mutate(prior = dunif(p_grid, 0, 1), likelihood = dbinom(y, n, p_grid)) %&gt;% mutate(posterior = likelihood * prior ) d %&gt;% pivot_longer(prior:posterior) %&gt;% # this line allows us to dictate the order in which the panels will appear mutate(name = factor(name, levels = c(&quot;prior&quot;, &quot;likelihood&quot;, &quot;posterior&quot;))) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = p_grid, y = value, fill = name)) + geom_area(show.legend = FALSE) + scale_fill_manual(values = c(&quot;grey&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;)) + facet_wrap(~ name, scales = &quot;free&quot;)+ theme_bw() Figure 3.1: Approximate posterior distribution obtained using Bayes rule with UNIF(0,1) prior. In this example, the normalizaing term P(y=0) is not considered. Figure 3.2: Approximate posterior distribution obtained using Bayes rule with UNIF(0.05,0.5) prior. In this example, the normalizaing term P(y=0) is not considered. Why is P(y=0) free of \\(\\theta\\)? The law of total probability for discrete parameter values can be used Suppose there are two possible values of parameter \\(\\theta\\), 0.5 and 0.1. Suppose we know the prior distribution of \\(\\theta\\): \\(P(\\theta = 0.5) = 0.8\\) and \\(P(\\theta = 0.1) = 0.2\\) Likelihood values are calculated given a known \\(\\theta\\), so then dont include the parameter \\(\\theta\\). Call these \\(P_{0.5} = P(Y = 0 \\mid \\theta = 0.5)\\) and \\(P_{0.1} = P(Y = 0 \\mid \\theta = 0.1)\\), Putting all components together using law of total probability, \\(P(Y = 0)\\) does not involved the unknown \\(\\theta\\) \\[P(Y = 0) = P(Y = 0 \\mid \\theta = 0.5)P(\\theta = 0.5) + P(Y = 0 \\mid \\theta = 0.1)P(\\theta = 0.1)\\] \\[ P(Y = 0) = P_{0.5} \\times 0.8 + P_{0.1} \\times 0.2 \\] In case of a continuous parameter value, we can obtain \\(P(y=0)\\) by integrating over the space of \\(\\theta\\) as following \\[P(y=0) = \\int_{\\theta=0}^{\\theta=1} P(y=0 \\mid \\theta) P(\\theta) \\ d \\theta\\] Integrating over \\(\\theta\\) is analogous to summing over a set of discrete values of \\(\\theta\\). After integration over \\(\\theta\\), \\(\\theta\\) is no longer featured in \\(P(y=0)\\). In this example, we have \\[P(y=0) = \\int_{\\theta=0}^{\\theta=1} P(y=0 \\mid \\theta) \\times \\frac{1}{1-0} \\ d \\theta \\] \\[P(y=0) = \\int_{\\theta=0}^{\\theta=1} P(y=0 \\mid \\theta) \\times \\frac{1}{0.5-0.05} \\ d \\theta \\] #Integration in R with one variable; #Unif(0,1); integrand &lt;- function(theta) {(1-theta)^6} normalizing_constant&lt;-integrate(integrand, lower = 0, upper = 1) normalizing_constant ## 0.1428571 with absolute error &lt; 0.0000000000000016 #Unif(0.05,0.5); integrand2 &lt;- function(theta) {((1-theta)^6)/(0.5-0.05)} normalizing_constant2&lt;-integrate(integrand2, lower = 0, upper = 1) normalizing_constant2 ## 0.3174603 with absolute error &lt; 0.0000000000000035 d &lt;- tibble(p_grid = seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = 1000), y = 0, n = 6) %&gt;% mutate(prior1 = dunif(p_grid, 0, 1), prior2 = dunif(p_grid, 0.05, 0.5), likelihood = dbinom(y, n, p_grid)) %&gt;% mutate(posterior1 = likelihood * prior1 / normalizing_constant$value, posterior2 = likelihood * prior2 / normalizing_constant2$value) d %&gt;% pivot_longer(posterior1:posterior2) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = p_grid, y = value, group = as.factor(name))) + geom_area(aes(fill = name),position=&quot;identity&quot;) + scale_fill_manual(name = &quot;Prior&quot;, labels = c(&quot;UNIF(0,1)&quot;,&quot;UNIF(0.05,0.5)&quot;),values = c(&quot;#d8b365&quot;, &quot;#5ab4ac&quot;)) + geom_vline(xintercept = 0.2, size=1) + annotate(&quot;text&quot;, x=0.3, y=6, label= expression(paste(theta, &quot;=0.2&quot;)), size = 5) + labs(x = expression(theta), y = &quot;posterior probability density&quot;, title=&quot;Posterior distribution given uniform priors and binary data&quot;)+ theme_bw() Figure 3.3: Posterior distribution obtained using Bayes rule with UNIF(0,1) and UNIF(0.05,0.5) priors Practice posterior estimation with brms package in R (Tutorial Practice) we will introduce MCMC in later sessions. dat1&lt;-data.frame(y=rep(0,6)) fit1 &lt;- brm(data = dat1, family = bernoulli(link = &quot;identity&quot;), y ~ 1, prior = c(prior(uniform(0, 1), class = Intercept)), iter = 1000 + 2500, warmup = 1000, chains = 2, cores = 2, seed = 123) fit2 &lt;- brm(data = dat1, family = bernoulli(link = &quot;identity&quot;), y ~ 1, prior = c(prior(uniform(0.05, 0.5), class = Intercept)), iter = 1000 + 2500, warmup = 1000, chains = 2, cores = 2, seed = 123) summary(fit1) summary(fit2) plot(fit1) plot(fit2) mcmc_areas( fit1, pars = c(&quot;b_Intercept&quot;), prob = 0.80, # 80% inner intervals; prob_outer = 0.95, # 99% outter intervals; point_est = &quot;mean&quot; ) mcmc_areas( fit2, pars = c(&quot;b_Intercept&quot;), prob = 0.80, # 80% inner intervals; prob_outer = 0.95, # 99% outter intervals; point_est = &quot;mean&quot; ) hypothesis(fit1, &#39;Intercept &lt; 0.2&#39;) hypothesis(fit2, &#39;Intercept &lt; 0.2&#39;) 3.2.2 The Beta-binomial model With a single sample of \\(n\\) binary outcomes, we have one unknown parameter: \\(\\theta\\) and \\(0 \\leq \\theta \\leq 1\\). We need a prior distribution for \\(\\theta\\) (e.g., proportion, risk, probability of event etc): \\(P(\\theta)\\) To express indifference between all values of \\(\\theta\\), we can use a uniform distribution on \\(\\theta\\), as we did in the previous example To express belief (e.g. based on external evidence) that some values of \\(\\theta\\) are more likely that others, it is convenient to use a beta distribution This has two parameters, often labelled as \\(\\alpha\\) (also written as a) and \\(\\beta\\) (also written as b), which we can choose to represent the strength of the external evidence If a parameter has a Beta(a,b) distribution, then the prior mean is \\[\\frac{a}{a+b}\\] The beta distribution prior for the binomial is useful for illustrating how the Bayesian approach combines prior information and new data Beta-binomial model Recall the likelihood for a binomial outcome of x successes in n trials, \\[ P(x \\mid \\theta) \\propto \\theta^x (1-\\theta)^{n-x}\\] The \\(Beta(\\alpha,\\beta)\\) prior has the same functional form for \\(\\theta\\), \\[ P( \\theta) \\propto \\theta^{\\alpha-1} (1-\\theta)^{\\beta-1}\\] We find the posterior as \\[\\begin{align} P(\\theta \\mid x) &amp; \\propto P(x \\mid \\theta) \\times P( \\theta) \\\\ &amp; \\propto \\theta^x (1-\\theta)^{n-x} \\times \\theta^{\\alpha-1} (1-\\theta)^{\\beta-1} \\\\ &amp; \\propto \\theta^{x+\\alpha-1} (1-\\theta)^{n-x+\\beta-1} \\end{align}\\] Thus, comparing to the \\(Beta(\\alpha,\\beta)\\) prior, the posterior just changes the exponents by adding x and n-x, respectively. Comparing to the prior, make two changes to get the posterior: \\(a \\rightarrow a+x\\), [a + number of events] \\(b \\rightarrow b+(n-x)\\), [b + number of non-events] Quite simply, when \\(x\\) events have been observed in n subjects, the prior \\[ \\theta \\sim Beta(\\alpha, \\beta) \\] gives the posterior \\[ \\theta \\mid x \\sim Beta(\\alpha+x, \\beta+n-x) \\] The prior and posterior are both beta distributions! Interpretation of Beta Prior Suppose we start with a beta prior with small parameters \\[ \\theta \\sim Beta(0.001, 0.001) \\] Observe x events in n trials, the posterior \\[ \\theta \\mid x \\sim Beta(0.001+x, 0.001+n-x) \\approx Beta(x,n-x)\\] Posterior mean of \\(\\theta \\approx \\frac{x}{n}\\), the equivalent to the MLE based only on the data Interpretation of the \\(Beta(\\alpha,\\beta)\\) prior. Like having seen \\(\\alpha\\) events and \\(\\beta\\) non events in a sample size of \\(\\alpha + \\beta\\) Strength of prior information equivalent to prior sample size \\(\\alpha + \\beta\\) Prior mean = \\(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha + \\beta}\\) Consider Beta(3,7)and Beta(12,28) priors Gold line: prior belief that assumes approximately 3 events in 10 subjects Blue line: prior belief that assumes approximately 12 events in 40(=12+28) subjects Plot Beta densities in R (Tutorial Practice) Try plotting Beta(2,8), Beta(8,2), and Beta(8,8). Example R code provided below. a&lt;-2 b&lt;-2 d &lt;- tibble(theta = seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = 101)) %&gt;% mutate(priorDensity = dbeta(theta, shape1 = a,shape2 = b)) ggplot(d, aes(theta, priorDensity))+ geom_line()+ xlab(expression(theta))+ ylab(expression(p(theta)))+ ggtitle(paste0(&quot;Beta distribution with &quot;, &quot;a = &quot;,a,&quot;; b = &quot;,b))+ theme_bw() Summarizing Posterior Distribution Since we know the form of the posterior distribution, we can easily calculate functions such as: Posterior mean \\(E(\\theta) = \\frac{\\alpha+x}{\\alpha + \\beta+n}\\) 95% Credible intervals (we will talk more about them next week) \\(P(\\theta &lt; 0.2)\\), \\(P(\\theta &lt; 0.5)\\), \\(P(0.4&lt; \\theta &lt; 0.6)\\), etc, which can be directly used to make probabilistic statement about the \\(\\theta\\). E.g., the probability of the posterior adverse event rate &lt; 0.2 is about 0.95. Generate informative plots for assessing priors and posteriors. All this can easily be done using R. Beta densities posterior summary in R (Tutorial Practice) Suppose we observe 1 adverse events among 10 patients and we assume the prior distribution of adverse event proportion \\(\\theta \\sim Beta(1,1)\\). What is the posterior Beta distribution of \\(\\theta\\)? What is the posterior mean Beta distribution of \\(\\theta\\)? What is the posterior probability \\(P(\\theta&lt;0.2)\\)? Data overwhelming the prior The posterior for the beta-binomial model after seeing x events in n trials is \\(\\theta \\mid x ~ Beta(\\alpha + x, \\beta + n - x)\\) with posterior mean as \\[E(\\theta \\mid x) = \\frac{\\alpha + x}{\\alpha + \\beta + n}\\] In \\(n \\gg \\alpha + \\beta\\) and \\(x \\gg \\alpha\\) (sample size and number of events is large), recall when using prior \\(Beta(0.001, 0.001)\\), \\[ E(\\theta \\mid x) = \\frac{\\alpha + x}{\\alpha + \\beta + n} \\approx \\frac{x}{n}\\] Here, prior is of little importance! A Beta(1,1) is Unif(0,1) When \\(\\alpha = \\beta = 1\\), \\(P(\\theta) \\propto \\theta^{1-1}(1-\\theta)^{1-1} = 1\\), which is the probability density of a unif(0,1). Posterior mean as a weighted average The posterior mean is \\[\\begin{align} E(\\theta \\mid x) &amp; = \\frac{\\alpha + x}{\\alpha + \\beta + n} \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{\\alpha }{\\alpha + \\beta + n} + \\frac{x }{\\alpha + \\beta + n}\\\\ &amp; = \\Big( \\frac{\\alpha+ \\beta }{\\alpha + \\beta + n} \\Big) \\times \\Big( \\frac{\\alpha }{\\alpha + \\beta} \\Big) + \\Big( \\frac{n }{\\alpha + \\beta + n} \\Big) \\times \\Big( \\frac{x }{n} \\Big) \\\\ &amp; = w \\times \\Big( \\frac{\\alpha }{\\alpha + \\beta} \\Big) + (1-w) \\times \\Big( \\frac{x }{n} \\Big) \\\\ &amp; = w \\times (\\text{prior mean}) + (1-w) \\times (\\text{sample estimate}) \\end{align}\\] Where \\(w\\) is the ratio of the prior sample size to the total sample size \\[ w = \\frac{\\alpha+ \\beta }{\\alpha + \\beta + n}.\\] This is a common theme in Bayesian models with actual prior information The posterior distribution will lie between the prior and likelihood The posterior mean is a weighted average of the prior mean and data-based estimate As the sample size increases, the contribution of the prior diminishes Revisit the adverse event example, now using the beta-binomial model Suppose you have observed 0 adverse events in 6 patients in a phase I clinical trial on a given dose of a drug Assume a prior: \\(\\theta \\sim Beta(1,1)\\) ; What is the posterior distribution? How much evidence that the AE rate is &lt; 20%? Find \\(P(\\theta &lt; 0.2)\\) using the posterior distribution? What is the AE rate at a lower dose was 1/6? Can we use this external evidence? New prior for the lower dose, \\(\\theta \\sim Beta(1,5)\\) New Posterior is given 0 adverse events in 6 patients: \\(\\theta \\sim Beta(1,11)\\) Find \\(P(\\theta &lt; 0.2)\\). 3.2.3 The Normal-normal model Parameters with normal priors and likelihoods Continuing with a single parameter model The likelihood of the parameter given some data is that of a normal distribution with known variance \\(\\sigma^2\\) \\[ y \\mid \\theta \\sim N(\\theta, \\sigma^2) \\] suppose the prior for \\(\\theta\\), the mean, follows a normal distribution \\[ \\theta \\sim N(\\mu_0, V_0)\\] We want to make inference about \\(\\theta\\) given the data y, what is the posterior distribution \\(P(\\theta \\mid y)\\)? Normal-normal model 1. The normal model (likelihood) of one data point Consider a single observation \\(y\\) from a normal distribution parameterized by a mean \\(\\theta\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), we assume that \\(\\sigma^2\\) is known. The normal likelihood for \\(y\\) given \\(\\theta\\) is \\[ P(y\\mid \\theta) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} e^{-\\frac{(y-\\theta)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}, y \\in (-\\infty, \\infty)\\] The \\(E(y) = \\theta\\) and \\(V(y) = \\sigma^2\\) and \\(SD(y) = \\sigma\\). Given \\(y \\mid \\theta \\sim N(\\theta,\\sigma^2 )\\), \\(z = \\frac{y-\\theta}{\\sigma} \\sim N(0,1)\\). Thus, if we rescale \\(y\\) by \\(\\sigma\\), we have 95%CI of y: \\(\\theta \\pm 1.96 \\times \\sigma\\) 2. Prior We can often use a normal prior to represent \\(\\theta \\sim N(\\mu_0, V_0)\\) \\(\\mu_0\\) is the prior mean \\(V_0\\) is the prior variance, which expresses the uncertainty around the mean \\(\\mu_0\\) \\(\\tau_0 = \\frac{1}{V_0}\\) is called precision, it can also be used to express the uncertainty around the mean, e.g. \\(\\theta \\sim N(\\mu_0, \\tau_0)\\) High precision = low variance, in other words, the distribution of the normal random variable \\(\\theta\\) is closely centered around its mean. 3. Posterior With a normal prior and a normal likelihood of the data given parameter \\(\\theta\\), (here we use precision to express the normal distributions) \\[ \\theta \\sim N(\\mu_0,\\tau_0 ) \\text{ and } y \\mid \\theta \\sim N(\\theta,\\tau_y )\\] where \\(\\tau_y = \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2}\\) is the precision of the observed data It can be proven mathematically using the Bayes rule that the posterior distribution given a normal prior and normal likelihood is also normal, \\[ \\theta \\mid y \\sim N(\\mu_1, \\tau_1)\\] The posterior mean \\(\\mu_1\\) is \\[ \\frac{\\tau_0 \\times \\mu_0 + \\tau_y \\times y}{\\tau_0+ \\tau_y} \\] The posterior precision is \\[ \\tau_1 = \\tau_0 + \\tau_y\\] Again, the prior and posterior are both normal distributions! Posterior mean as a weighted average of the prior mean and data-based estimate Using the precision parameters \\[ \\tau_y = \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2_y} \\text{ and } \\tau_0 = \\frac{1}{V_0}\\] The posterior distribution of \\(\\theta\\) is then \\[\\theta \\mid y \\sim N(\\mu_1, \\tau_1)\\] where the mean and precision are \\[\\begin{align} &amp; \\mu_1 = \\Big(\\frac{\\tau_0}{\\tau_0 + \\tau_y}\\Big) \\times \\mu_0 + \\Big(\\frac{\\tau_y}{\\tau_0 + \\tau_y}\\Big) \\times y \\\\ &amp; \\tau_1 = \\tau_0 + \\tau_y \\end{align}\\] The posterior mean is a weighted sum of the prior mean and the observed value. The weights are the relative precisions of the prior and the likelihood \\[\\mu_1 = w_0 \\times \\mu_0 + w_y \\times y\\] \\[w_0 = \\frac{\\tau_0}{\\tau_0 + \\tau_y}\\] and \\[w_y = 1-w_0 = \\frac{\\tau_y}{\\tau_0 + \\tau_y}\\] Data overwhelming the prior and vice versa With relatively low prior precision (imprecise prior and substantial data), i.e., \\(\\tau_0 \\ll \\tau_y\\) and \\(0 \\approx w_0 \\ll w_y \\approx 1\\), \\[ \\mu_1 = w_0 \\times \\mu_0 + w_y \\times y \\approx y\\] With relative little data and aprior that is not too diffuse, i.e., \\(\\tau_y \\ll \\tau_0\\) and \\(0 \\approx w_y \\ll w_0 \\approx 1\\), \\[ \\mu_1 = w_0 \\times \\mu_0 + w_y \\times y \\approx \\mu_0\\] In most cases, the posterior mean is a compromise between what we believed before and what we observed in the data. Normal model with multiple observations Consider a set of \\(n\\) observations \\(y = (y_1, \\ldots, y_n)\\) sample from a \\(N(\\theta, \\sigma^2)\\), where \\(y_1,\\ldots, y_n\\) are identically, independently distributed and \\(y_i \\sim N(\\theta, \\sigma^2)\\), \\(i = 1, \\ldots, n\\). The normal likelihood of the joint distribution \\(y = (y_1, \\ldots, y_n)\\) is \\[\\begin{align} P((y_1, \\ldots, y_n \\mid \\theta) &amp;= \\prod_{i=1}^n P(y_i \\mid \\theta) \\\\ &amp; = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} e^{-\\frac{(y_i-\\theta)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}, y \\in (-\\infty, \\infty) \\end{align}\\] Given prior \\(\\theta \\sim N(\\mu_0, \\tau_0)\\), the posterior of \\(\\theta \\mid y\\) is \\[P(\\theta \\mid y_1, \\ldots, y_n) = N(\\mu_n, \\tau_n)\\] where the posterior mean \\(\\mu_n\\) is \\[\\mu_n = \\frac{\\tau_0 \\times \\mu_0 + n\\tau_y \\times \\bar{y}}{\\tau_0+ n\\tau_y} = \\Big( \\frac{\\tau_0}{\\tau_0+ n\\tau_y} \\Big) \\times \\mu_0 + \\Big( \\frac{n\\tau_y}{\\tau_0+ n\\tau_y} \\Big) \\times \\bar{y}\\] and the posterior precision is \\[ \\tau_n = \\tau_0 + n\\tau_y\\] \\(\\bar{y} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^2y_i}{n}\\) is the sample mean and \\(\\tau_y = \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2}\\) Again, the posterior mean is a weighted sum between prior and data. As sample size \\(n \\rightarrow \\infty\\), \\(\\Big( \\frac{\\tau_0}{\\tau_0+ n\\tau_y} \\Big) \\rightarrow 0\\) and \\(\\Big( \\frac{n\\tau_y}{\\tau_0+ n\\tau_y} \\Big) \\rightarrow 1\\), data will overwhelm the prior and dominate the posterior distribution. The use of normal-normal model in clinical applications Consider estimating a parameter \\(\\theta\\), e.g. mean, log-hazard ratio, log-odds-ratio, log-relative-risk Suppose we have an estimate of \\(\\theta\\); We will call it \\(y\\) and let \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2_y\\) be the estimated variance This estimate \\(y\\) can be viewed as a single data observation of \\(\\theta\\)! In large samples, it is approximately true that \\(y \\sim N(\\theta, \\sigma^2_y)\\), where \\(\\theta\\) is the true value and \\(\\sigma^2_y\\) is the true variance (sample size dependent) and the 95%CI of \\(y\\) is \\(\\theta \\pm 1.96 \\times \\sigma\\). We can construct a normal likelihood of data for the parameter \\(\\theta\\) as \\[y \\mid N(\\theta, \\hat{\\sigma}^2_y)\\] Treatment effect estimate on the mean For this example, we will simulate data for a small study of n=100 subjects and randomized 50% to treat=0 and 50% to treat=1 (mimicking an RCT). We will then generate the outcome Y from a normal distribution depending on the treatment indicator. Suppose we have the following table of results from a linear regression estimating treatment effect \\(\\theta\\) on the outcome n &lt;- 100 set.seed(1234) treat &lt;- 1*(runif(n, min = 0, max = 1)&lt;0.5) y &lt;- 5*treat+rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd =10) fit&lt;-lm(y~treat) summary(fit) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = y ~ treat) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -19.8662 -6.7095 -0.5731 5.7503 24.1866 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

Relying on the large sample approximation, we assume that the estimate y arose from a normal distribution with true mean \\(\\theta\\), We treat the observed standard error \\(\\hat{\\sigma}_y = 1.918\\) as the true standard deviation of \\(y\\) Recall, the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of a parameter estimate is called its standard error This gives us the likelihood \\[y \\mid \\theta \\sim N(\\theta, 1.918^2)\\] The width of the 95% CI is approximately equal to \\(2 \\times 1.96 \\times \\sigma_y\\) Suppose we are not provided with \\(\\sigma_y\\) from the table of results, but know the 95% CI of y is (1.568,0.064), we can calculate \\(\\sigma_y\\) with \\[\\sigma_y = \\frac{7.84- 0.321}{2\\times 1.96}=1.918\\] The normal likelihood is this example is \\(y \\sim N(4.08, 1.918^2)\\), if we assume a prior \\(\\theta \\sim N(0, 2 \\times 1.918^2)\\), we have a posterior \\[\\begin{align} &amp; \\theta \\mid y \\sim N(\\mu_1, \\tau_1) \\\\ \\mu_1 &amp;= \\frac{ \\frac{1}{prior.sd^2} }{\\frac{1}{prior.sd^2} + \\frac{1}{se.obs^2} } \\times prior.mean + \\frac{\\frac{1}{se.obs^2}}{\\frac{1}{prior.sd^2} + \\frac{1}{se.obs^2}} \\times y.obs \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{ \\frac{1}{2 \\times 1.918^2} }{\\frac{1}{2 \\times 1.918^2} + \\frac{1}{1.918^2} } \\times 0 + \\frac{\\frac{1}{1.918^2}}{\\frac{1}{2 \\times 1.918^2} + \\frac{1}{1.918^2}} \\times 4.08 = 2.72 \\\\ \\tau_1 &amp; = \\tau_0 + \\tau_y \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{1}{prior.sd^2} + \\frac{1}{se.obs^2} \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{1}{2 \\times 1.918^2} + \\frac{1}{1.918^2} = 0.408 \\end{align}\\] d &lt;- tibble(theta = seq(from = -10, to = 15, length.out = 200), y.obs=4.08, se.obs=1.918, prior.mean=0, prior.sd=sqrt(2)*1.918) %&gt;% mutate(priorDensity = dnorm(theta, prior.mean, prior.sd)) %&gt;% mutate(likelihood.0 = dnorm(theta, y.obs, se.obs)) %&gt;% mutate(w = (1/se.obs^2)/(1/se.obs^2 + 1/prior.sd^2)) %&gt;% mutate(post.prec = 1/se.obs^2 + 1/prior.sd^2) %&gt;% mutate(posteriorDensity = dnorm(theta, w*y.obs+(1-w)*prior.mean, sqrt(1/post.prec))) %&gt;% mutate(likelihood = likelihood.0/sum(diff(theta)*likelihood.0[-1])) %&gt;% pivot_longer(cols=c(priorDensity,likelihood,posteriorDensity),names_to=&quot;Function&quot;,values_to=&quot;p&quot;) d$Function &lt;- factor(d$Function, levels=c(&quot;priorDensity&quot;,&quot;likelihood&quot;,&quot;posteriorDensity&quot;), labels=c(&quot;Prior&quot;,&quot;Likelihood&quot;,&quot;Posterior&quot;)) p&lt;-ggplot(d, aes(theta, p,colour=Function))+ geom_line(size=1)+ xlab(expression(theta))+ ylab(expression(p(theta)))+ theme(legend.position = &quot;bottom&quot;)+ scale_colour_manual(values=c(&quot;goldenrod&quot;,&quot;steelblue&quot;,&quot;black&quot;)) +theme_bw() p Hazard Ratio on time-to-event from Cox proportional hazard model In memory of Sir David Cox, 1925-2022 Effect of a Resuscitation Strategy Targeting Peripheral Perfusion Status vs Serum Lactate Levels on 28-Day Mortality Among Patients With Septic Shock The ANDROMEDA-SHOCK Randomized Clinical Trial (Hernández et al. 2019) Open-access link: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2724361 We are interested to make inference on the hazard ratio of peripheral perfusion versus Lactate level on 28-Day mortality among patients with septic shock. We obtain a point estimate of HR and its 95%CI from Table 2 of (Hernández et al. 2019). Figure 3.4: HR estimates of the effectiveness of peripheral perfusion on primary outcome - Death within 28 days 1. The normal likelihood on log(HR) The estimated adjusted (HR) on 28-day mortality, 0.75 (0.55 to 1.02), is called the observed datum (viewed as a single data observation on \\(\\theta\\), denoted as \\(y\\)) Its known that log of the parameter estimate, such as HR, RR and OR, follow a normal distribution around its true log value. Thus, We need to use the reported output information in order to specify the likelihood for on the log scale. Let \\(\\theta\\) denote the random variable representing log(HR) Let \\(y\\) denote an observed data point of \\(\\theta\\), we have \\(y \\sim N(\\theta, \\sigma_y^2)\\), where \\(\\theta\\) is log(HR) and \\(sigma_y\\) is the standard error of the log(HR) In order to get \\(\\sigma_y^2\\) from the result table, we will use the reported 95% CI of the log of HR! The limits of the CI for the log value are obtained by taking the logs of the reported CI, i.e., 95% CI on the log(HR) in this example is [log(0.55)=-0.598, log(1.02)=0.02]. Take the width of the 95% CI and divided by \\(2\\times 1.96\\), we have \\[\\hat{\\sigma}_y = \\frac{log(1.02) - log(0.55)}{2\\times 1.96} = 0.158\\] We use \\(\\hat{\\sigma}_y\\) to approximate \\(\\sigma_y\\), therefore, the data likelihood \\(y \\mid \\theta \\sim (\\theta,0.158^2)\\) where we have observed \\(y=log(0.75)=-0.287\\) 2. The prior for log(HR) Suppose we consider a neutral prior for log(HR), such that 95% of the prior for probability for the HR is in the range 0.8 to 1.25 and the median of HR is 1 (indicating the intervention is neither beneficial or harmful) The prior of \\(log(HR) \\sim N(log(1), \\sigma_0^2)\\), where \\[ \\sigma_0 = \\frac{\\log(1.25) - \\log(0.8)}{2 \\times 1.96} = 0.11\\] We can express the prior normal distribution on log(HR) as \\[\\theta \\sim N(\\mu_0 = 0, \\sigma_0^2=0.11^2)\\] We specify normal prior for log(HR)!. In probability theory, a lognormal distribution is a continuous probability distribution of a random variable whose logarithm is normally distributed. In this case, HR follows a lognormal distribution! 3. The posterior of log(HR) Given prior \\(\\theta \\sim N(0, 0.11^2)\\) and likelihood \\(y \\mid \\theta \\sim (\\theta,0.158^2)\\) where \\(y=log(0.75)=-0.287\\) Prior precision is \\(\\frac{1}{0.11^2} = 82.6\\) and the likelihood precision is \\(\\frac{1}{0.158^2} = 40.1\\), we can see that the prior has more information than the likelihood! The posterior precision on log(HR) is \\(\\tau_1 = 82.6 + 40.1=122.7\\) The posterior mean is \\[ \\frac{82.6}{82.6 + 40.1} \\times log(1) + \\frac{40.1}{82.6 + 40.1} \\times log(0.75) = -0.094\\] The posterior variance of \\(\\log(HR) = \\frac{1}{122.7}\\) and the posterior standard deviation is \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{122.7}} = 0.09\\), thus \\[\\theta \\mid y \\sim N(\\mu_1 = -0.094, \\sigma_1^2 = 0.09^2\\] The posterior median HR = exp(-0.094) = 0.91 and the posterior 95% Credible Interval for HR is \\[\\exp(-0.094 \\pm 1.96\\times 0.09) \\rightarrow (0.763, 1.086) \\] #prior on log(HR); mu0&lt;- 0 sd0&lt;- 0.11 prec0 &lt;- 1/sd0^2 #likelihood on log(HR); ybar&lt;- -0.287 sd.ybar&lt;- 0.158 prec.y &lt;- 1/sd.ybar^2 #posterior on log(HR) prec1 &lt;- prec0 + prec.y mu1 &lt;- (prec0 * mu0 + prec.y*ybar)/prec1 sigma1 &lt;- 1/sqrt(prec1) mu.plot &lt;- seq(ybar-1,ybar+1, length.out=200) lik &lt;- dnorm(ybar, mu.plot, sd.ybar) prior &lt;- dnorm(mu.plot, mu0, sd0) posterior&lt;- dnorm(mu.plot, mu1,sigma1) d&lt;-data.frame(mu.plot=rep(mu.plot, 3), p =c(lik,prior,posterior), Function=rep(c(&quot;likelihood&quot;,&quot;prior&quot;,&quot;posterior&quot;),each=length(mu.plot))) p1&lt;- ggplot(d, aes(mu.plot, p,colour=Function))+ geom_line(size = 1)+ xlab(&quot;log(HR)&quot;)+ ylab(&quot;Probability Density&quot;)+ scale_colour_manual(values=c(&quot;goldenrod&quot;,&quot;steelblue&quot;,&quot;black&quot;))+ theme_bw()+ ggtitle(&quot;Neural prior on log(HR): plot on log(HR) scale&quot;) p2&lt;- ggplot(d, aes(exp(mu.plot), p,colour=Function))+ geom_line(size = 1)+ xlab(&quot;HR&quot;)+ ylab(&quot;Probability Density&quot;)+ scale_colour_manual(values=c(&quot;goldenrod&quot;,&quot;steelblue&quot;,&quot;black&quot;))+ theme_bw()+ ggtitle(&quot;Neural prior on log(HR): plot on HR scale&quot;) ggarrange(p1,p2, nrow=2) Posterior summary statistics from R thresholds&lt;-c(1,0.8) res &lt;-exp( qnorm(c(0.5, 0.025, 0.975), mu1, sigma1)) res &lt;- c(res, pnorm(log(thresholds), mu1, sigma1)) names(res) &lt;- c(&quot;median&quot;,&quot;q2.5&quot;,&quot;q97.5&quot;,paste0(&quot;Pr(OR &lt; &quot;,thresholds,&quot;)&quot;)) res ## median q2.5 q97.5 Pr(OR &lt; 1) Pr(OR &lt; 0.8) ## 0.9105607 0.7628965 1.0868065 0.8503338 0.0757977 3.3 Summary of Conjugate priors &amp; models There are a small number of prior-likelihood pairs where the prior and the posterior are in the same family (e.g., both beta, both normal): these are called conjugate models These posterior distributions can be computed without specialized software These examples are useful for illustrating how Bayesian methods combine prior information with data They have only limited practical usefulness - limits on types priors, limits on number of parameters They are useful teaching tools, soon we will see how we can extend beyond these simple models 3.4 Why Bayesian: Statistical Estimation Revisit 3.4.1 Classic Frequentist Inference Many common intuitive data-based estimators are maximum likelihood estimators sample mean, \\(\\bar{x}\\) sample proportion, \\(\\hat{p}\\) rate of an event, \\(\\hat{\\lambda} = \\frac{\\text{Number Events}}{\\text{Follow-up Time}}\\) least square estimators from linear regression model OR &amp; RR HR, cox regression uses partial-likelihood approach Likelihood-based inference does two things Finds the MLE, the parameter value that is most likely, given the observed data. Finds how much curvature there is near this maximum. This leads to estimates of standard errors and CIs. The 95% CI refers to the frequency with which hypothetical future random intervals from repeated sampling constructed in the same way will include the true value A particular interval will either include the value or not. It does not mean that the interval contains the true value with 0.95 probability, i.e. we do not have \\(P(\\theta \\mid data)\\) Hypothesis Testing in a nutshell Hypothesis testing is a procedure for determining whether a hypothesis is valid or not, based on sample evidence Set up two hypotheses: Null (\\(H_0\\)) &amp; lternative (\\(H_A\\)) \\(H_0\\), Specifies population parameter of interest &amp; proposes baseline value for it. Null presumed true unless disproved \\(H_A\\), Contains value of parameter different from H0; typically what you want to show Specify appropriate model (find test statistic) Z test, T test, chi-square test etc under the assumption that the model is correct Mechanics (calculate p-value) We want to compare data to what we would expect to see if \\(H_0\\) was true and ask how likely it is to get these data, if \\(H_0\\) was true P-value is used to quantify evidence against \\(H_0\\); The probability of getting equally or more extreme data (i.e. test statistic) under repeated sampling if \\(H_0\\) is true \\[ P_{-value} = P\\Bigg( \\begin{matrix} \\text{observed or more} \\\\ \\text{extreme test statistics} \\end{matrix} \\mid H_0 \\ is \\ true \\Bigg) \\] P-value tells how surprising are data you observed under \\(H_0\\) Arrive at conclusion: Reject \\(H_0\\) or not Decisions about rejecting H0 or not are usually done by computing a p-value and comparing to \\(\\alpha\\), significance level significance level, an arbitrary threshold for P-value to define rare/extreme event. If P-value falls below this level, we conclude results are statistically significance and we reject the null Hypothesis Tests Errors Type I error (\\(\\alpha\\)): \\(H_0\\) is true, but we reject it \\(\\alpha = P(Reject \\ H_0 | H_0 \\ is \\ true)\\) We commonly control for Type I error - innocent until proven guilty Type II error (\\(\\beta\\)): \\(H_0\\) is false, but we fail reject it \\(\\beta = P(Fail \\ to \\ Reject \\ H_0 | H_0 \\ is \\ false)\\) A tests ability to detect a false null hypothesis is called the power of the test, \\(1-\\beta\\) For any test, there is trade-off between \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) (e.g., for fixed n, decreasing\\(\\alpha\\) increases \\(\\beta\\), vice-versa ) Revisit Estimating a Proportion Suppose you have observed 6 patients in a Phase I RCT on a given dose of drug, - 0 out of 6 patients have had an adverse event - decision to escalate to a higher dose if its unlikely that the current dosing results in a true proportion of adverse events above 20% Let \\(\\theta\\) be the true adverse event proportion, we want to test the following hypothesis \\[H_0: \\theta = 0.2\\] \\[H_a: \\theta \\leq 0.2\\] We implement an exact binomial test binom.test(x=0, n=6, p = 0.2, alternative = c(&quot;less&quot;), conf.level = 0.95) ## ## Exact binomial test ## ## data: 0 and 6 ## number of successes = 0, number of trials = 6, p-value = 0.2621 ## alternative hypothesis: true probability of success is less than 0.2 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.0000000 0.3930378 ## sample estimates: ## probability of success ## 0 P-value = P(0 or more extreme: \\(X \\leq 0 \\mid \\theta = 0.2\\)) = P( 0 adverse event among 6 patients \\(\\mid\\) a binomial model with \\(\\theta = 0.2\\)) = dbinom(x=0,size=6,prob=0.2) = 0.262144. Using significance level/type I error at 5%, 0.262144 &gt; 0.05, thus, we fail to reject \\(H_0\\). More about p-value (Wasserstein and Lazar 2016) By its definition, P-values do not measure the probability that the studied hypothesis is true, or the probability that the data were produced by random chance alone. Scientific conclusions and business or policy decisions should not be based only on whether a p-value passes a specific threshold. A conclusion does not immediately become true on one side of the divide and false on the other. A p-value, or statistical significance, does not measure the size of an effect or the importance of a result. By itself, a p-value does not provide a good measure of evidence regarding a model or hypothesis. For example, a p-value near 0.05 taken by itself offers only weak evidence against the null hypothesis. absence of evidence is not evidence of absence Inference is performed based on data that have not been observed, under an assumption that is almost certain not to be true Would you be willing to bet that the true probability a coin comes up heads is exactly P(head)=0.5, or that the exact true adverse rate is fixed at 0.2? 3.4.2 Bayesian Inference In Bayesian statistics, inference is done using the posterior distribution Given a posterior distribution, we can calculate any summary of it we like \\(P(0.008 &lt; \\theta &lt; 0.012)\\), \\(P( \\theta &lt; 0.1)\\), interval with 95% probability of containing \\(\\theta\\) We can use quantities to summarize the posterior distribution (mean, median, sd, IQR) We can plot the density function and shade areas of interest Posterior uncertainty Posterior variance is used to characterize the posterior uncertainty In most cases, it is smaller than the prior variance In some cases, for some models, the opposite is true, when prior is in direct conflict with the data Credible intervals play the role of the confidence intervals For the 95% credible interval \\([\\alpha, \\beta]\\), \\(P(\\alpha&lt; \\theta &lt;\\beta \\mid y)\\) = 0.95 Hypothesis testing For a continuous parameter \\(\\theta\\), the hypothesis that \\(\\theta\\) is exactly some fix value (e.g., 1 for OR) is rarely reasonable and its more of interest to estimate a posterior distribution or a corresponding interval estimate of \\(\\theta\\) The question Dose \\(\\theta\\) equal 1 can be rephrased as what is the posterior distribution for \\(\\theta\\) Bayesian Factor for one-sided test The Bayes Factor (BF) compares the posterior odds to the prior odds, and provides insight into just how much our updated belief about the parameter evolved upon observing sample data In a hypothesis test of two competing hypotheses, \\(H_0\\) vs \\(H_a\\), \\[\\text{Bayes Factor} = \\frac{\\text{Posterior odds}}{\\text{Prior odds}} = \\frac{\\frac{P(H_0 \\mid y)}{P(H_1 \\mid y)}}{\\frac{P(H_0)}{P(H_a)}}\\] Example: (Beta-binomial model) Data - Data: 0 out of 6 patients have had an adverse event - Prior: \\(\\theta \\sim Beta(1,1)\\) - Posterior: \\(\\theta \\mid y \\sim Beta(1,7)\\) Let \\(\\theta\\) be the true adverse event proportion, we are interested in testing the following hypothesis - \\(H_0: \\theta \\geq 0.2\\) - \\(H_a: \\theta \\leq 0.2\\) \\[BF = \\frac{\\frac{P(\\theta \\geq 0.2 \\mid y)}{P(\\theta \\leq 0.2 \\mid y)}}{\\frac{P(\\theta \\geq 0.2)}{P(\\theta \\leq 0.2)}} = \\frac{\\frac{qbeta(0.2, 1, 7)}{1-qbeta(0.2, 1, 7)}}{\\frac{qbeta(0.2, 1, 1)}{1- qbeta(0.2, 1, 1)}} = \\frac{0.032}{0.25} = 0.1295647\\] Bayes factor calibration table from (David J. Spiegelhalter, Abrams, and Myles 2003) Figure 3.5: Calibration of Bayes factor (likelihood ratio) provided by Jeffreys from Spiegelhalter 2003 Our BF estimate, 1/10 &lt; 0.1295647 &lt; 1/3.2, based on the calibration table, we would conclude substantial evidence against \\(H_0: \\theta \\geq 0.2\\) and in favour of \\(H_0: \\theta \\leq 0.2\\). Posterior predictive distributions Often we are interested in extending our (Bayesian) analysis using priors and data, and predicting outcomes in data observed in the future e.g., predicting number of successes in a future trial , where \\(n* = 25\\), 25 new observations Essentially we want the probability density $P(y^* y), where with \\(y^*\\) we denote the new data This probability is not always possible to compute directly, it does not correspond to some known distribution We will see that these kinds of questions can be answered using Markov Chain Monte Carlo method and brms (coming up in a couple of weeks) Posterior predictive distribution Let \\(y^*\\) denote a new data, the posterior predictive distribution for \\(y^*\\) is \\[P(y^* \\mid y) = \\int P(y^* \\mid \\theta) P(\\theta \\mid y) \\ d \\theta\\] The posterior predictive distribution as an average of conditional predictions over the posterior distribution of \\(\\theta\\) We assume conditional independence of \\(y^*\\) and \\(y\\) given \\(\\theta\\) In the beta-binomial adverse event example, let \\(y^*\\) denote the result of a new trial of 6 patients given posterior \\(\\theta \\mid y \\sim Beta(1,7)\\), \\[P(y^* \\mid y) = \\int_0^1 {6 \\choose y^*} \\theta^{y^*} (1- \\theta)^{6-y^*} P(\\theta \\mid y) \\ d \\theta, y^* \\in \\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\] \\[P(\\theta \\mid y) = \\frac{\\Gamma(8)}{\\Gamma(1)\\Gamma(7)} \\theta^{0}(1-theta)^{6}\\] likelihood&lt;-length(7) for (i in 1:7) { integrand_pred &lt;- function(theta) { (choose(6, i-1)*theta^(i-1)*(1-theta)^(6-i+1))*((gamma(8)/gamma(1)/gamma(7))*(1-theta)^6)} likelihood[i] &lt;- integrate(integrand_pred,lower = 0, upper = 1)$value } posterior_pred&lt;-data.frame(y_star=0:6, likelihood = likelihood) knitr::kable(posterior_pred, caption = &quot;Posterior predictive distribution for a new trial of 6 patients&quot;) Table 3.1: Posterior predictive distribution for a new trial of 6 patients y_star likelihood 0 0.5384615 1 0.2692308 2 0.1223776 3 0.0489510 4 0.0163170 5 0.0040793 6 0.0005828 sum(posterior_pred$likelihood) ## [1] 1 Why Bayesian? Practical Reasons Apart from making more sense to use then P-value, the modern Bayesian approach offers some practical advantages to data analysis Prior information Direct probability statements Subjectivity acknowledged and formally represented Prior information Science rarely proceeds in the absence of any prior information or opinion Bayesian reasoning allows the formal incorporation of this opinion The classical approach introduces prior information and opinion in study planning and, informally, at the  stage of results - high risk of inconsistency In Bayesian approach: For small sample sizes, a prior will rein in imprecise data-based estimates For large sample sizes, most priors are overwhelmed by the likelihood (data) Probability Statements A result of a Bayesian analysis is a posterior distribution, \\(P(\\theta \\mid data)\\), for an unknown parameter (e.g. an odds ratio \\(\\theta\\)) given the data We can compute probabilities directly from the posterior distribution \\[P(\\theta &lt; 1 \\mid data) = \\int_0^1 P(\\theta \\mid data) d\\theta\\] this is the area under the posterior density \\(P(\\theta \\mid data)\\) between the value of 0 and 1 for \\(\\theta\\) this is what we prefer p-value to be! we can define \\(P(\\theta &lt; 0.9 )\\) as a clincically important effect, then we calculate the probability of \\(P(\\theta &lt; 0.9 \\mid data )\\). No need to choose a significance level, we can directly use this probably to make clinical decision! We can also ask which is more likely - an important effect (\\(H_a\\)) or an unimportant effect (\\(H_0\\)), e.g., \\(P(\\theta &lt; 0.9)\\) or \\(P(0.95 &lt; \\theta &lt; 1.05)\\) We can compute probabilities for statements combining more than one parameter (e.g. regression parameters), e.g., \\(P(\\beta_1 &lt;0 \\cap \\beta_2 &lt;0)\\), gives the probability that two slopes are both negative. Statements about compound events can facilitate direct group comparisons \\[ E(Y_i \\mid stage_i) = \\beta_1 + \\beta_2 \\times I(stage_i=II) + \\beta_3 \\times I(stage_i=III) + \\beta_4 \\times I(stage_i=IV)\\] The probability that mean of outcome under stage II is greater than mean under stage I: \\(P(\\beta_2 &gt; 0 )\\) The probability that mean of outcome under stage IV is greater than mean under stage II: \\(P(\\beta_4 &gt; \\beta_2 )\\) Summary Practical advantages of Bayesian approach Direct probability statements Incorporation of external evidence Complex models can be built step-by-step Makes you understand the analysis better Disadvantages including Learning how to code Need to know more about distributions Require good probability and statistical model knowledge More time consuming (computationally more expensive with complex model and multiple parameters) R Session information ## R version 4.0.5 (2021-03-31) ## Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit) ## Running under: Windows 10 x64 (build 19042) ## ## Matrix products: ## ## locale: ## [1] LC_COLLATE=English_Canada.1252 LC_CTYPE=English_Canada.1252 ## [3] LC_MONETARY=English_Canada.1252 LC_NUMERIC=C ## [5] LC_TIME=English_Canada.1252 ## ## attached base packages: ## [1] grid stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods ## [8] base ## ## other attached packages: ## [1] bayesplot_1.8.1 ggmcmc_1.5.1.1 truncnorm_1.0-8 ## [4] ggpubr_0.4.0 tweenr_1.0.2 gganimate_1.0.7 ## [7] VennDiagram_1.7.1 futile.logger_1.4.3 brms_2.16.3 ## [10] Rcpp_1.0.7 forcats_0.5.1 stringr_1.4.0 ## [13] dplyr_1.0.7 purrr_0.3.4 readr_2.1.1 ## [16] tidyr_1.1.4 tibble_3.1.6 ggplot2_3.3.5 ## [19] tidyverse_1.3.1 References "],["Prior.html", "Session 4 Prior Distributions 4.1 Choosing priors 4.2 Default clincial priors 4.3 Historical data (meta-analysis) 4.4 Hierarchical priors and shrinkage priors", " Session 4 Prior Distributions Learn different ways of selecting and constructing priors Prior distributions used in clinical studies Introduction to hierarchical priors for random effects Introduction to sparsity promoting prior for Bayesian regression variable selection 4.1 Choosing priors Types of prior Generally speaking, there are two types of priors: informative and noninformative. Priors with information on values of parameters, informative priors Priors that charaterize personal/expert opinion Prior elicitation Historical data or past evidence Default priors in clincial studies Informative priors used for computational efficiency and variable selection objective and non-informative priors Flat prior, vague prior, and weakly-informative priors Important consideration before choosing a prior Choice of prior does affect the posterior, however, prior is only one part of Bayesian modelling. Prior is not unique and there is no one correct prior distribution! In many situations with large sample sizes, the posterior distribution is not too sensitive to reasonable changes in prior. When working with rare outcomes (e.g., small disease cohort), changes in prior distribution can influence posterior distribution One criticism of Bayesian inference is in its incorporation of priors, which is considered as a subjective modelling choice. However, any statistical analysis is inherently subjective, frequentist or Bayesian. Subjective choice of prior can often be beneficial Sensitivity analysis is crucial in assessing the impact of particular distributions on the conclusions. when we are working with small samples, informative prior allows us to explicitly incorporate past evidence and expert knowledge we can also use sparsity promoting prior (i.e., shrinkage prior) to reduce the number of parameters to be estimated to improve estimation efficiency and avoid over-fitting 4.1.1 Eliciting priors from experts Elicitation is the process of representing the knowledge of one or more experts - expert knowledge is useful! concerning an uncertain quantity as a probability distribution for that quantity (i.e. as a random variable with some distribution) Good elicitation methods are formal, statistically rigorous, and use carefully considered probabilistic judgement techniques in practice, elicitation follows pre-developed elicitation protocol elicitation process often involve training and discussion between experts and statisticians to eliminate bias, mis-interpretation, over-optimistic thinking  Aggregating expert judgement There are two general approaches to summarizing the estimates from the experts. Aggregate the distributions Elicit a distribution from each expert separately Combine these multiple distribution using mathematical aggregation, also called pooling Aggregate the experts gather expert belief and elicit a single distribution, also called behavioural aggregation. Three protocols Most popular. Sheffield Elicitation Framework (SHELF). The SHELF protocol is a behavioral aggregation method that uses two rounds of judgments. (OHagan et al. 2006) In the first round, individuals make private judgements In the second round, those judgments are reviewed before the group agrees on consensus judgement. Cooke protocol. A mathematical aggregation approach weights expert responses by their likely accuracy. (Cooke et al. 1991) The likely accuracy is calculated using a seed value. Expert who more accurately predict the seed value are weighted more. Delphi Method The Delphi is similar to SHELF as it is a behavioral aggregation method with two or more rounds except that anonymity is maintained in terms of who gave which answers. unlike SHELF, experts provide their judgments individually with no interaction and a pooling rule is required across expert final distributions.

Spiegelhalter, Abrams, and Myles 2003) 4.2.1 Non-informative or reference priors (Pros) It is attractive to seek a noninformative prior to use as a baseline analysis such analyses have been suggested as a way of making probability statements about parameters without being explicitly Bayesian (David J. Spiegelhalter 2004) (Cons) However, nonninformative priors are nonsensical and can lead to inference problems, especially in smaller samples can have a strong impact particularly when events are rare. Prior Choice Recommendations and Wiki developed by the stan team, https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Prior-Choice-Recommendations this guide is written by statisticians, thus, recommendations are primary for non-informative, vague, and weakly informative priors General principle on this guide provides a start 1. Noninformative Prior on Proportion Suppose you are estimating the 30-day mortality after elective non-cardiac surgery, what is an uninformative prior for the proportion dying? An off the shelf uninformative priors for binomial model are \\(\\theta \\sim U(0,1) \\equiv Beta(1,1)\\) Jeffreys prior, \\(\\theta \\sim Beta(0.5,0.5)\\) Prior median q2.5 q97.5 Pr(\\(\\theta\\)&lt; 0.25) Pr(\\(\\theta\\)&lt; 0.5) Pr(\\(\\theta\\)&lt; 0.75) Beta(1,1) 0.5 0.025 0.975 0.25 0.5 0.75 Beta(0.5,0.5) 0.5 0.002 0.998 0.333 0.5 0.667 2. Noninformative Prior on log-relative risk Suppose you want to estimate the relative risk for death in a clinical trial Relative risk modelling works with the log-relative risk (as it has an approximately normal likelihood) An off the shelf uninformative prior with a large variance might be \\[\\log(RR) = \\theta \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2 = 10^2)\\] Prior 95% Credible Interval for log(RR) is -19.6 to 19.6 Prior 95% Credible Interval for RR is \\(3 \\times 10^{-9}\\) to \\(3 \\times 10^{9}\\) A more sensible choice, \\(N(0,5^2)\\), for log scale OR, RR, and HR.

These issues resolve somewhat with larger data sets With a precise likelihood (e.g., large sample size or large number of events), data rescues you from allowing implausible values. 1. ISSUE with Uniform Priors uniform priors on one scale are not uniform on a transformed scale Suppose we set prior \\(\\theta \\sim U(0,1)\\) as an uninformative prior on the parameter quantifying risk of adverse event, probability \\(\\theta\\) Prior distribution on log(\\(\\frac{\\theta}{1-\\theta}\\)), which is also called the logit of \\(\\theta\\) is no longer uniformly distributed 2. Using large variance normal distribution as non-informative prior How is a normal distribution N(0,\\(100^2\\)), with its bell-shape, uninformative? It does not put equal density on all points, as the density drops off from zero in each direction The key is that it is locally uniform In the region where a parameter is likely to lie, the normal distribution is flat. 4.2.2 Minimally informative prior Use substantive knowledge to put most prior weight on possible values, without being too restrictive From example, a RR for mortality in a trial, a prior with most weight on values of 0.66 to 1.5, a N(0,1) prior would be considered suitable. For the between-person standard deviation of a 0-40 quality of life instrument, a prior with most weight on values under 10, a possible prior would be Gamma(0.1,0.1) on the precision. 4.2.3 Skeptical Prior priors that express doubts about large effects Mathematically speaking, a sceptical prior about a treatment effect will have a mean of zero and a shape chosen to include plausible treatment differences which determines the degree of scepticism. This is centred at no effect and a 95% CR extends to a minimally clinically important difference (MCID) Skeptical prior will shrink back observed results towards the null effect If under the skeptical prior, the posterior results support conclusion of effectiveness (results suggest departure from null), the skeptic is convinced! Spiegelhater suggested a reasonable degree of scepticism maybe feeling that the study has been designed around an alternative hypothesis that is optimistic, formalized by a prior with only a small probability say 5% that the effect is as large as the optimistic alternative Example from EOLIA trial(Goligher et al. 2018) MCID for 60-day mortality in RR comparing between ECMO and Rescue Lung Injury in Severe ARDS is 0.67, log(0.4/0.6) = -0.405. 0 (null, RR=1) will be the mean of the skeptical prior! Let P(RR&lt;0.67) = P(log(RR)&lt; -0.405) = 0.05, that is saying the probability of the ECOMO being effective beyond MCID is only 5%. Employee z transformation on normal distribution, we have \\[ P(log(RR)&lt; -0.405) = P(\\frac{log(RR)-0}{\\sigma} &lt; \\frac{(-0.405) - 0}{\\sigma}) = P(z &lt; \\frac{-0.405}{\\sigma}) =0.05\\] \\[ qnorm(0.05,0,1) \\times \\sigma = -0.405 \\] \\[\\sigma = \\frac{0.405}{qnorm(0.05,0,1)} = 0.246\\] yielding a candidate skeptical prior on log(RR) ~ \\(N(0,0.246^2)\\) 4.2.4 Optimistic/enthusiastic Prior This is centred at the MCID and a 95% CR extends to no effect Optimistic Prior will move observed results towards the MCID If a optimist is convinced that there is no effect, the evidence for no effect is strong Spiegelhater suggested an enthusiastic prior centred on the althernative hypothesis (meeting MCID) and with a low chance (say 5% probability) that the true treatment benefit is negative! Example from EOLIA trial(Goligher et al. 2018) MCID for 60-day mortality in RR comparing between ECOMO and Rescue Lung Injury in Severe ARDS is 0.67, log(0.4/0.6) = -0.405. -0.405 will be the mean of the enthusiastic prior! Let P(RR&gt;1) = P(log(RR)&gt; 0) = 0.05, that is saying the probability of the ECMO not being effective is 5%. Employee z transformation on normal distribution, we have \\[ P(log(RR)&gt; 0) = P(\\frac{log(RR)-(-0.405)}{\\sigma}&gt; \\frac{0-(-0.405)}{\\sigma}) = P(z &gt; \\frac{0.405}{\\sigma}) =0.05\\] \\[P(z &lt; \\frac{0.405}{\\sigma}) = 1- 0.05 = 0.95\\] \\[qnorm(0.95,0,1) \\times \\sigma = 0.405\\] \\[\\sigma = \\frac{0.405}{qnorm(0.95,0,1)} = 0.246\\] yielding a candidate enthusiastic prior on log(RR) ~ \\(N(-0.405,0.246^2)\\) 4.2.5 Evaluating Priors? Section 5.8 (David J. Spiegelhalter, Abrams, and Myles 2003) introduced a Box approach to comparing priors with subsequent data in assessing the ability of the chosen subjective prior to predict the true benefit of intervention The prior is used to derive a predictive distribution for future observations, and thus to calculate the chance of a result with lower predictive ordinate than that actually observed: when the predictive distribution is symmetric and unimodal, this is analagous to a traditional two-sided P-value in measuring the predictive probability of getting a result at least as extreme as that observed. this assessment can be used to evaluate prior distributions parameter values When we have several candidate prior distributions (e.g. lognormal, beta, normal, etc), we can use goodness-of-fit statistics like Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Cramer-von Mises, and Anderson-Darl to evaluate which distribution best fit the prior belief density. fitdistrplus: An R Package for Fitting Distributions 4.3 Historical data (meta-analysis) Incorporating historical data in Bayesian analysis these can be formalized as a means of using past evidence as a basis for a prior distribution for a parameter of interest Additional reading: Section 5.4 Summary of External Evidence of (David J. Spiegelhalter, Abrams, and Myles 2003) Meta-analysis is a very useful tool for evidence synthesis in clinical research Juan Pablo will give us a guest lecture on Bayesian meta-analysis after reading week! We can directly use published meta-analysis results to construct priors if not available, one can also complete a meta-analysis to synthesis evidence for prior construction These types of prior are called data-derived priors. For example, in the Bayesian reanalysis of the EOLIA trial, data-derived priors are constructed from a Bayesian meta-analysis of published relevant studies. The posterior distribution (updated belief) of treatment effect is produced by combining data-derived prior with data from the current study. Downweighting: To reflect concerns about possible differences between the current and previous studies, the variance of the past studies can be inflated to receive less weight in the analysis on the pooled estimate of effect. Data-derived prior from the Bayesian reanalysis of the EOLIA trial(Goligher et al. 2018) Data-derived prior was developed based on three relevant studies from a meta-analysis of ECMO for ARDS (Munshi et al. 2014) Three studies are:(Peek et al. 2009), (Pham et al. 2013), and (Noah et al. 2011) Figure 4.1: In-hospital mortality. Forest plot showing pooled analysis of four randomized controlled trials and six observational studies comparing extracorporeal life support (ECLS) to conventional mechanical ventilation (MV) from Munshi et al 2014. After fitting a random effect model, the pooled RR is estimated as 0.64 with 95% CI (0.38 - 1.06). We now express this prior as a normal likelihood on the log(RR) scale and consider three scenarios of downweighting (10%, 50% and 100%). CI.normal &lt;- log(c(0.38, 1.06)) sigma &lt;- (CI.normal[2] - CI.normal[1])/(2*1.96) mu &lt;- log(0.64) xlabs &lt;- c(0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 3) noweight &lt;- dnorm(log(seq(0.1,3, length=201)), mu, sigma) weight50 &lt;- dnorm(log(seq(0.1,3, length=201)), mu, sigma/sqrt(0.5)) weight10 &lt;- dnorm(log(seq(0.1,3, length=201)), mu, sigma/sqrt(0.1)) d &lt;- data.frame(logrr.range = rep(log(seq(0.1,3, length=201)),3), plog.rr = c(noweight, weight50, weight10), Weighting = rep(c(&quot;100% weight&quot;,&quot;50% weight&quot;,&quot;10% weight&quot;),each=201)) ggplot(d, aes(logrr.range, plog.rr,colour=Weighting))+ geom_line(size = 1)+ xlab(&quot;RR&quot;)+ ylab(&quot;probability density&quot;)+ ylim(c(0,2))+ scale_x_continuous(breaks = log(xlabs),labels=xlabs, limits=c(log(0.1), log(3)))+ scale_colour_manual(values=c(&quot;goldenrod&quot;,&quot;steelblue&quot;,&quot;black&quot;))+ theme_bw()+ ggtitle(&quot;Data-derived priors&quot;) 4.4 Hierarchical priors and shrinkage priors Dont necessarily have information about the value of a parameter Expresses knowledge, for example, that a several of parameters, \\(\\mu_1, \\ldots, \\mu_k\\) have a common mean, without saying what that mean is \\[\\mu_i \\sim N(\\mu_0, \\sigma^2) \\] The Bayesian posterior means for \\(\\mu_i\\) will be shrunk towards the overall mean \\(\\mu_0\\) - (this is called formally as exchangeability) By sharing information this way, individual estimates have smaller variances - A way of avoiding overfitting These are priors on higher level parameters (variances and random effects are the most common) Example prior distribution for variance - Gamma Distribution Shrinkage priors in Bayesian penalization aim to shrink small effects to zero while maintaining true large effects. The horseshoe prior is a member of the family of multivariate scale mixtures of normals, and is therefore closely related to widely used approaches for sparse Bayesian learning, including, among others, Laplace priors (e.g. the LASSO) and Student-t priors. Example horseshoe prior Consider a linear regression model with covariates \\(X = (x_1, \\ldots, x_p)\\). \\(\\beta\\) is a \\(1\\times p\\) vector of regression coefficient and i index number of subject. \\[y_i = \\beta^TX_i + \\epsilon_i, \\ e_i \\sim N(0,\\sigma^2), \\ i = 1, \\ldots, n\\] The horseshoe prior (hierarchical) is given as: \\[\\beta_j \\mid \\lambda_j, \\tau, \\sim N(0, \\lambda_j^2 \\tau^2)\\] \\[\\lambda_j \\sim halfCauchy(0,1), j = 1, \\ldots, p.\\] \\[\\tau \\sim halfCauchy(0,\\tau_0)\\] \\(\\lambda_j\\) is called local shrinkage parameter - enable some \\(\\beta\\) to escape the shrinkage \\(\\tau\\) is the global shrinkage parameter - shrink all \\(\\beta\\) towards zero, thus removing the corresponding covariate from the regression model. # Visually compare normal, student_t, cauchy, laplace, and product_normal compare_priors &lt;- function(scale = 1, df_t = 2, xlim = c(-10, 10)) { dt_loc_scale &lt;- function(x, df, location, scale) { 1/scale * dt((x - location)/scale, df) } dlaplace &lt;- function(x, location, scale) { 0.5 / scale * exp(-abs(x - location) / scale) } dproduct_normal &lt;- function(x, scale) { besselK(abs(x) / scale ^ 2, nu = 0) / (scale ^ 2 * pi) } stat_dist &lt;- function(dist, ...) { ggplot2::stat_function(ggplot2::aes_(color = dist), ...) } ggplot2::ggplot(data.frame(x = xlim), ggplot2::aes(x)) + stat_dist(&quot;normal&quot;, size = .75, fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 0, sd = scale)) + stat_dist(&quot;student_t&quot;, size = .75, fun = dt_loc_scale, args = list(df = df_t, location = 0, scale = scale)) + stat_dist(&quot;cauchy&quot;, size = .75, linetype = 2, fun = dcauchy, args = list(location = 0, scale = scale)) + stat_dist(&quot;laplace&quot;, size = .75, linetype = 2, fun = dlaplace, args = list(location = 0, scale = scale)) + stat_dist(&quot;product_normal&quot;, size = .75, linetype = 2, fun = dproduct_normal,args = list(scale = 1))+theme_bw() } # Cauchy has fattest tails, followed by student_t, laplace, and normal compare_priors() R Session information ## R version 4.0.5 (2021-03-31) ## Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit) ## Running under: Windows 10 x64 (build 19042) ## ## Matrix products: ## ## locale: ## [1] LC_COLLATE=English_Canada.1252 LC_CTYPE=English_Canada.1252 ## [3] LC_MONETARY=English_Canada.1252 LC_NUMERIC=C ## [5] LC_TIME=English_Canada.1252 ## ## attached base packages: ## [1] grid stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods ## [8] base ## ## other attached packages: ## [1] extraDistr_1.9.1 MCMCpack_1.6-0 MASS_7.3-53.1 ## [4] coda_0.19-4 SHELF_1.8.0 bayesplot_1.8.1 ## [7] ggmcmc_1.5.1.1 truncnorm_1.0-8 ggpubr_0.4.0 ## [10] tweenr_1.0.2 gganimate_1.0.7 VennDiagram_1.7.1 ## [13] futile.logger_1.4.3 brms_2.16.3 Rcpp_1.0.7 ## [16] forcats_0.5.1 stringr_1.4.0 dplyr_1.0.7 ## [19] purrr_0.3.4 readr_2.1.1 tidyr_1.1.4 ## [22] tibble_3.1.6 ggplot2_3.3.5 tidyverse_1.3.1 References "],["BayesMCMC.html", "Session 5 Bayesian estimation with MCMC 5.1 Introduction to Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods 5.2 MCMC diganostics - assess convergence 5.3 Example Bayesian modelling with brms", " Session 5 Bayesian estimation with MCMC Introduction to MCMC and two common MCMC algorithm MCMC in action with brms on Bayesian modelling Learn about Markov chain diagnostics 5.1 Introduction to Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods Oftentimes, the posterior distribution might not be easily determined (as in the case of conjugate models), especially when we are modelling multiple parameters We need numerical ways to compute posterior distribution Recall the posterior distribution takes form \\[P(\\theta \\mid y) = \\frac{P(y \\mid \\theta) \\times P(\\theta)}{ P(y)} = \\frac{P(y \\mid \\theta) \\ P(\\theta)}{ \\int P(y \\mid \\theta) \\ P(\\theta) \\ d\\theta}\\] - The denominator \\(\\int P(y \\mid \\theta) \\ P(\\theta) \\ d\\theta\\) is the challenging part to be determined numerically. Markov chain simulation is used when it is not possible or not computationally efficient to sample \\(\\theta\\) directly from \\(P(\\theta \\mid y)\\) instead we sample iteratively to draw from a distribution that becomes closer to \\(P(\\theta \\mid y)\\) Markov Chain simulation methods comprise a class of algorithms for sampling from a (complex) probability distribution and have application outside Bayesian statistics as well, especially in statistical optimization Markov chain is named after Russian mathematician Andrey Markov (1856-1922). A Markov chain or Markov process is a stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event. Monte Carlo sampling Notation: Let \\(\\theta = (\\theta_1, \\ldots, \\theta_p)\\) be the collection of \\(p\\) number of parameters in a Bayesian model Let \\(Y = (Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n)\\) be the observed data of \\(n\\) subjects The posterior \\(P(\\theta \\mid Y)\\) is a probability distribution If \\(\\theta^{(1)}, \\ldots, \\theta^{(s)}\\) are \\(s\\) samples from \\(P(\\theta \\mid Y)\\), then the mean of the \\(s\\) samples approximate the posterior mean! This posterior draws provides approximations of the posterior summaries of interest (e.g., posterior mean, posterior medium, P(theta &lt; 0.9), etc) How to draw samples from some arbitrary distribution \\(P(\\theta \\mid Y)\\)? There are many algorithms and software options for performing MC sampling Software: OpenBUGS, WinBUGS, JAGS; STAN; INLA (Iteratively Nested Laplace Approximation, this is not MC) PyMC (via Python) In this session, we will introduce two MCMC algorithms: Metropolis algorithm and Gibbs sampler. brms package uses stan which samples following Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm and No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) HMC is a bit more complex, we will not cover the algorithm in this session, for those who are interested see http://www.mcmchandbook.net/HandbookChapter5.pdf and (Hoffman, Gelman, et al. 2014) HMC is documented to be more efficient then Gibbs and Metropolis algorithm (less iterations are needed). Online interactive MCMC demonstration app, https://chi-feng.github.io/mcmc-demo/ 5.1.1 Gibbs sampling As a simple example, suppose we want to estimate mean \\(\\mu\\) and precision \\(\\tau = 1/\\sigma^2\\) of a normal distribution. We place the priors \\(\\mu \\sim N(0,1)\\) and \\(\\tau \\sim Gamma(1,1)\\). \\[ Y \\mid \\mu, \\tau \\sim N(\\mu, \\frac{1}{\\tau})\\] \\[\\mu \\sim N(0,1)\\] \\[\\tau \\sim Gamma(1,1)\\] Then the conditional posterior distributions for \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\tau\\) are \\[ P( \\mu \\mid \\tau, Y) \\propto N(\\frac{\\tau \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i}{1 + n \\tau},\\frac{1}{1+n\\tau})\\] \\[ P( \\tau \\mid \\mu, Y) \\propto Gamma(1 + \\frac{n}{2}, 1+\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-\\mu)^2}{2})\\] We want to alternate between sampling from these two conditional posteriors. Lets simulate \\(n=100\\) data, \\(Y\\), from N(10,1). The true data mean \\(\\mu = 10\\) and \\(\\tau = 1\\), our posterior distribution of \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\tau\\) should approximate the true value First, lets complete Gibbs sampling with 10 draws we specify an initial value of \\((\\mu^{(1)}, \\tau^{(1)}) = (1,1)\\) to start our chain Given \\(\\tau^{(1)} = 1\\), plug in this value to \\(P( \\mu \\mid \\tau, Y) \\propto N(\\frac{ \\sum_{i=1}^{100} y_i}{1 + 100 },\\frac{1}{1+100})\\), now we draw 1 sample of \\(\\mu\\), \\(\\mu^{(2)}\\) from \\(P( \\mu \\mid \\tau, Y)\\) Given \\(\\mu^{(1)} = 1\\) plug in this value to \\(P( \\tau \\mid \\mu, Y) \\propto Gamma(1 + \\frac{100}{2}, 1+\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{100} (y_i-1)^2}{2})\\), now we draw 1 sample of \\(\\tau\\), \\(\\tau{(2)}\\) from \\(P( \\tau \\mid \\mu, Y)\\) we repeat sample 2 and 3 and construct a posterior set of \\((\\mu^{(1)}, \\tau^{(1)}, \\ldots, (\\mu^{(10)}, \\tau^{(10)}))\\) set.seed(123) # Prior distribution for mu and tau; prior_mean &lt;- 0 # the prior on mu; prior_precision &lt;- 1 # the prior on mu; prior_shape &lt;- 1 # alpha in prior for precision; prior_rate &lt;- 1 # beta in prior for precision; # data likelihood - simulated from N(10,1) num_obs &lt;- 100 # size of our data true_mean &lt;- 10 true_precision &lt;- 1 Y &lt;- rnorm(num_obs, true_mean, 1/sqrt(true_precision)) # number of Gibbs samples of posterior draws; num_sample &lt;- 10 # posterior sample vector initiated with NULL value; mu &lt;- rep(NA, num_sample) tau &lt;- rep(NA, num_sample) #initialize values on mu and tau mu[1] &lt;- 1 tau[1] &lt;- 1 for(i in 2:num_sample){ # i %% 2 means for i mod 2 == 0, that is for i with even value; if(i %% 2){ mu[i] &lt;- rnorm( 1, mean = (prior_precision * prior_mean + tau[i-1] * sum(Y)) / (prior_precision + num_obs * tau[i-1]), sd = sqrt(1 / (prior_precision + num_obs * tau[i-1])) ) tau[i] &lt;- tau[i-1] } else{ mu[i] &lt;- mu[i-1] tau[i] &lt;- rgamma( 1, shape = prior_shape + num_obs / 2, rate = prior_rate + sum((Y - mu[i])^2) / 2 ) } } posterior &lt;- data.frame(order = 1:num_sample, mu, tau) ggplot(posterior, aes(x = mu, y = tau, label = order)) + geom_point() + geom_text(hjust=0, vjust=0) + geom_path(aes(x = mu, y = tau), alpha = 0.3) + ggtitle(paste0(&#39;Path plot of Gibbs sampling with &#39;, num_sample, &#39; draws&#39;) )+ xlab(expression(mu)) + ylab(expression(tau)) + theme_bw() Now, lets complete Gibbs sampling with 2000 draws we also consider discarding the first 1000 draws (burn-in) and making posterior inference using only the last 900 draws! p3 &lt;- ggplot(posterior[(burnin+1):num_sample,]) + geom_histogram( aes(x = mu, y = stat(count) / sum(count)), alpha = 0.5) + geom_vline( aes(xintercept = quantile(posterior[(burnin+1):num_sample,2], 0.025)), color = &#39;red&#39;) + geom_vline( aes(xintercept = 10), color = &#39;red&#39;) + geom_vline( aes(xintercept = quantile(posterior[(burnin+1):num_sample,2], 0.975)), color = &#39;red&#39;) + ylab(&#39;Posterior distribution - Relative frequency&#39;) + xlab(expression(mu)) + ggtitle(bquote(&#39;With burn-in, 95% credible interval of &#39; ~ mu)) p4 &lt;- ggplot(posterior[(burnin+1):num_sample,]) + geom_histogram( aes(x = tau, y = stat(count) / sum(count)), alpha = 0.5) + geom_vline( aes(xintercept = quantile(posterior[(burnin+1):num_sample,3], 0.025)), color = &#39;red&#39;) + geom_vline( aes(xintercept = 1), color = &#39;red&#39;) + geom_vline( aes(xintercept = quantile(posterior[(burnin+1):num_sample,3], 0.975)), color = &#39;red&#39;) + ylab(&#39;Posterior distribution - Relative frequency&#39;) + xlab(expression(tau)) + ggtitle(bquote(&#39;With burn-in, 95% credible interval of &#39; ~ tau)) ggarrange(p3, p4, nrow = 1) p5 &lt;- ggplot(posterior[(burnin+1):num_sample,]) + geom_line( aes(x = order, y = mu)) + geom_hline( aes(yintercept = 10), color = &#39;red&#39;) + ylab(expression(mu)) + xlab(&#39;posterior draws&#39;) + ggtitle(bquote(&#39;Trace plot with burn-in of&#39; ~ mu)) p6 &lt;- ggplot(posterior[(burnin+1):num_sample,]) + geom_line( aes(x = order, y = tau)) + geom_hline( aes(yintercept = 1), color = &#39;red&#39;) + ylab(expression(tau)) + xlab(&#39;posterior draws&#39;) + ggtitle(bquote(&#39;Trace plot with burn-in of&#39; ~ tau)) ggarrange(p5, p6, nrow = 2) Summary OpenBUGS, WinBUGS, and JAGS use Gibbs sampling Gibbs sampling relies on conditional distributions as proposal distributions to sample each dimension the posterior distributions. Gibbs sampling generates a Markov chain of samples, each of which is correlated with nearby samples. in the example here, the next draw is sampled from posterior calculated using the previous draw! Generally, samples from the beginning of the chain (the burn-in period) may not accurately represent the desired distribution and are usually discarded 5.1.2 Metropolis algorithm Metropolis algorithm is an adaptation of a random walk with an acceptance/rejection rule to converge to a specified distribution The algorithm generally follows the following steps (following the Gibbs example): We specify an initial value of \\((\\mu^{(1)}, \\tau^{(1)}) = (1,1)\\) to start our chain Sample from a proposal joint distribution values for \\((\\mu^{(propose)}, \\tau^{(propose)})\\) Calculate the ratio (r) of the densities \\[r = \\frac{P(\\mu^{(propose)}, \\tau^{(propose)} \\mid y)}{P(\\mu^{(1)}, \\tau^{(1)} \\mid y)} = \\frac{P(y \\mid \\mu^{(propose)}, \\tau^{(propose)}) P(\\mu^{(propose)}) P(\\tau^{(propose)})}{P(y \\mid \\mu^{(1)}, \\tau^{(1)}) P(\\mu^{(1)}) P(\\tau^{(1)})}\\] - for this step, we can format the ratio in its log scale for easy calculation, log(r)! Sample u from an uniform distribution, \\(u \\sim Unif(0,1)\\) accept the proposed values, \\((\\mu^{(2)}, \\tau^{(2)}) = (\\mu^{(propose)}, \\tau^{(propose)})\\) if \\(u &lt; \\min(1,r)\\), otherwise reject the proposed values, keep \\((\\mu^{(2)}, \\tau^{(2)}) = (\\mu^{(1)}, \\tau^{(1)})\\) repeat step 2 to 5 for multiple iterations, forming our posterior draws!

Metropolis algorithm requires us to specify a proposal distribution involving some tuning, this can be tricky to set-up. A bad tuning parameter can result in lower acceptance rate (i.e., proposed value keeps getting rejected). Metropolis algorithm generates a Markov chain of samples, each of which is correlated with nearby samples. in the example here, the next proposed value for \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) is sampled from the proposal distribution using the previous draw! Again, its a good practice to discard beginning of the chain! 5.2 MCMC diganostics - assess convergence What does a good Markov chain look like? How can we tell if our Markov chain sample produces a reasonable approximation of the posterior? How big should our Markov chain sample size be? How many iterations to run? In this section, we provide a few diagnostic rules and principles A good reference paper on Bayesian workflow: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.01808.pdf, (Gelman et al. 2020) Figure 5.1: Bayesian workflow - Figure 1 from Gelman at al 2020 1. Choose good initial values and discard early iterations 2. Assessing convergence in long-run A commonly used numerical index in diagnosing convergence is \\(\\hat{R}\\), also called the potential scale reduction factor, proposed by Gelman and Rubin (1992) and later an extension for multivariate distributions by Brooks and Gelman (1997). \\(\\hat{R}\\) measures the ratio of the total variability combining multiple chains to the within-chain variability. recall in ANOVA, the \\(F\\)-ratio is a measure of \\[F = \\frac{\\text{Between-group difference} + \\text{error}}{\\text{error}}\\] \\(\\hat{R}\\) has a very similar meaning conceptually, with error meaning the within-chain variance. after the chains converge, there should be no differences between the chains, and so\\(\\hat{R}\\) should be very close to 1.0. Its recommended an \\(\\hat{R}\\) less than 1.1 for acceptable convergence of the Markov chains, but more recently a more stringent cutoff of 1.01 is proposed. Good Mixing - trace plot and auto-correlation plot One thing you should look at to diagnose the convergence of a Markov chain is the trace plot. Good mixing behaviour as it explores the region with most of the density smoothly and bounces from one point to another quickly. Bad mixing: although in every iteration a jump is made to a new value, the jump to the new value is relatively small, so it gonna takes a long time to get from one end of the distribution to another end, and it rarely explores all regions, therefore, if you stop the chain early, you can get a biased representation of the posterior distribution. Dependence of the iterations Autocorrelation provides another metric by which to evaluate whether our Markov chain sufficiently mimics the behaviour of an independent sample. Strong autocorrelation or dependence is a bad thing  it goes hand in hand with small effective sample size ratios, and thus provides a warning sign that our resulting posterior approximations might be unreliable. Autocorrelation Lag 1 autocorrelation measures the correlation between pairs of Markov chain values that are one step apart Lag k autocorrelation measures the correlation between pairs of Markov chain values that are k steps apart we can look at ACF plot for diagnostics, in R this can be examined using acf() function! # Gibbs example; acf(posterior[(1000+1):length(posterior$mu),2], main=expression(paste(&quot;Gibbs example &quot;,mu))) acf(posterior[(1000+1):length(posterior$tau),3], main=expression(paste(&quot;Gibbs example &quot;,tau))) Thinning we can perform thinning to achieve faster convergence! thinning the MCMC by keeping every kth simulation draw and discarding the rest for example, thin = 5, referring to keeping the 5th, 10th, , draws only! If the total MCMC iteration is 2000, for thin = 5, we will end-up with a posterior sample distribution of size = 2000/5 = 400. 5.2.1 Acceptance Rate If youre using the Metropolis/MH algorithm, you want to monitor the acceptance rate and make sure it is within optimal range. If you accept almost every time, that tells you that each time the chain only jumps a very small step (so that the acceptance ratio is close to 1 every time), which will make the algorithm slow in converging to the stationary distribution. If the acceptance rate is very low, then that says that the chain got stuck to just a few locations and it takes hundreds of iterations for it to make one jump. For the Metropolis/MH algorithm, an optimal acceptance rate would be something between 10% to 60%. 5.2.2 Diagnostics Using Multiple Chains Another important thing to check is to see the convergence with multiple chains. So far weve been just talking about one chain, but it is common practice to use two or more chains (and 4 chains are generally recommended nowadays), each starting at a different, preferably more extreme, place, and see whether they explore a similar region. 5.3 Example Bayesian modelling with brms 5.3.1 Example Bayesian logistic regression model In this example, we will conduct an analysis using a Bayesian logistic regression model. Data come from a cross-sectional study of 1,225 smokers over the age of 40. Each participant was assessed for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and characteristics of the type of cigarette they most frequently smoke were recorded. The objective of the study was to identify associations between COPD diagnosis and cigarette characteristics We will use the following variables from this data set: TYPE: Type of cigarette, 1 = Menthol, 0 = Regular NIC: Nicotine content, in mg TAR: Tar content, in mg LEN: Length of cigarette, in mm FLTR: 1 = Filter, 0 = No Vlter copd: 1 = COPD diagnosis, 0 = no COPD diagnosis BRAND_NAME TYPE NIC TAR CO LEN FLTR PACK STRENGTH STYLE OTHER pcopd copd ACCORD 0 0.2 3 1 68 1 HARD REGULAR 0.0752199 0 ACCORD 0 0.3 5 1 68 1 HARD REGULAR 0.0808916 0 American 0 0.8 14 14 83 1 HARD FULL FLAVOR 0.1009402 0 Austin 0 0.9 15 15 83 1 HARD FULL FLAVOR 0.1083241 0 Austin 0 0.8 11 13 83 1 HARD LIGHT 0.1009402 0 Austin 0 0.9 15 16 84 1 SOFT FULL FLAVOR 0.1073572 0 We fit a simple logistic regression, predicting the risk of Copd by Type of cigarette, Nicotine content, and Filter status.

(McElreath 2018) using one or more predictor variables to model the distribution of one or more outcome variables For a continuous outcome, we typically fit a linear regression model. Of course the relationship between outcome and predictors can be non-linear, in this case, we would consider fitting polynomial regression models or splines. For a categorical outcome, we will fit a generalized linear regression. We will cover this topic in future sessions. For a repeatedly measured outcome, we can fit a linear mixed-effect model (continuous outcome) or a generalized linear mixed-effect model (categorical outcome). 6.1 Normal Models and Linear Regression Conditional normal model Given its mean and variance, an observation has a normal distribution \\[ Y_i \\mid \\mu_i, \\sigma^2_i \\sim N( \\mu_i, \\sigma^2_i) \\] This is equivalent to the following statements \\[ Y_i = \\mu_i + e_i , \\ e_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)\\] We do not assume the collection of \\(Y_i, i=1, \\ldots, n\\) have a normal distribution Instead we assume the error term is normally distributed - a lesser assumption! In case of multiple predictors, \\(\\mu_i\\) becomes a weighted average of the \\(\\beta_j\\) values, the regression coefficient with \\(x_{ij}\\) denoting the predictors. For example, for two covariates we have \\[ E(y_i) = \\mu_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i1} + \\beta_2 x_{i2} \\] A polynomial regression model of 2 degrees on \\(x_{i1}\\) \\[ \\mu_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i1} + \\beta_2 x_{i2} + \\beta_3 x_{i1}^2 \\] Assumptions of linear regression models Independent observations Linear relationship We can check this assumption by examining marginal plots comparing the model predicted relationship between outcome and each continuous predictor and by examining the residual plot. Normality of the residuals Homoscedasticity Homoscedasticity in a model means that the residual is constant along the values of the dependent variable. Multidisciplinary Multicollinearity is the phenomenon when a number of the explanatory variables are strongly correlated. Correctly specified regression model This means that all relevant predictors for the response variable have been included in the model. This is often difficult to verify, but we can use posterior predictive distribution to check for regression fit. 6.1.1 One-sample and two-sample normal regression 1. One-sample If all observations have the same mean and variance, the likelihood is \\[ Y_i \\mid \\mu, \\sigma^2 \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\] Good candidate priors for \\(mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) are \\(\\mu \\sim N(\\text{sample mean}, \\text{sample sd})\\) or Student-T distributions (to handle heavy tails) \\(\\sigma \\sim \\text{half-t}(mean = 0, sd = \\text{sample sd}, df = 3)\\) Modelling height - Textbook example on the Howell data Suppose we want to fit a one-sample model on height using a dataset of anthropological measurements on a foraging people taken in the 1960s.

How to determine equal variance or not? Approach 1, visually examine the conditional mean by group. Approach 2, comparing models using information criteria (WAIC) or leave-one-out cross validation (LOO) (Vehtari, Gelman, and Gabry 2017) Both approaches confirm the equal variance model is the best model! plot(conditional_effects(fit_uneq), points = TRUE) waic1 &lt;- waic(fit_eq) waic2 &lt;- waic(fit_uneq) compare_ic(waic1, waic2) #equal var best model; ## WAIC SE ## fit_eq 85.98 4.25 ## fit_uneq 87.57 4.54 ## fit_eq - fit_uneq -1.59 0.60 loo1 &lt;- loo(fit_eq) loo2 &lt;- loo(fit_uneq) loo_compare(loo1, loo2) #equal var best model; ## elpd_diff se_diff ## fit_eq 0.0 0.0 ## fit_uneq -0.9 0.3 6.1.2 Linear regression The two-sample model is a special case of regression \\[\\mu_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i\\] Where \\(x_i = 0\\) for group 1 and \\(x_i = 1\\) for group 2 For group 1, \\(\\mu_i = \\beta_0\\), the intercept For group 2, \\(\\mu_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\) brms takes care of creating dummy variables! but be aware of what the reference group is and what the coefficients mean levels will be by default in alphabetical order - use the factor() statement to make a variable with the desired order Try fitting the two-sample sleep data without the intercept fit_eq2 &lt;- brm(data = sleep, family = gaussian, extra ~ -1 + group, #mean depends on group and one sigma iter = 10000, warmup = 5000, chains = 4, cores = 4, #instructions on MCMC seed = 123, # random number seed to make results reproducible silent = 2, refresh = 0) summary(fit_eq2) In general, for a regression model \\[ y_i \\mid \\mu_i, \\sigma^2_i \\sim N(\\mu_i, \\sigma^2_i)\\] \\[ \\mu_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i1} + \\ldots + \\beta_p x_{ip}\\] - where the \\(x_{ij}\\) can be continuous variables or dummy variables - the usual assumption on the variance is \\(\\sigma_i^2 = \\sigma^2\\) for all subjects (Homoscedasticity - equal variance assumption) - We can seen that is technically easier to relax this assumption in a Bayesian model! (two-sample unequal variance example) Predictions We can get the predictions fro the mean value at a given value of the predictors. For example, in simple linear regression model we have \\[E(Y\\mid X=x) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\] but recall that both \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) have posterior distributions For each posterior draws of \\((\\beta_0, \\beta_1)^s, s= 1, \\ldots, S\\), we have a different predicted mean \\[E(Y\\mid X=x, S=s) = \\beta_0^s + \\beta_1^s x\\] The set of values of these predictions across all sampled values give the posterior for the predicted mean Modelling height - Howell data revisit Lets descriptively examine the height distribution by weight, age, and sex We can see that the relationship between age and height is not linear we consider the following model \\[heights_i \\sim N(\\mu_i, \\sigma)\\] \\[\\mu_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\ weight_i + \\beta_2 \\ age_i + \\beta_3 \\ age_i^2 +\\beta_4 \\ \\text{I(sex=male)}\\] we consider the following prior distributions (diffuse normal on regression parameter and exponential distribution for \\(\\sigma\\)) \\[\\beta_0 \\sim N(0, 100) \\] \\[\\beta_1 \\sim N(0, 10) \\] \\[\\beta_2 \\sim N(0, 10) \\] \\[\\beta_3 \\sim N(0, 10) \\] \\[\\beta_4 \\sim N(0, 10) \\] \\[ \\sigma \\sim Gamma(1, 0.01) \\] Figure 6.2: Prior distributions we now fit this model in brms dat &lt;- dat %&gt;% mutate(male = factor(male, labels = c(&quot;female&quot;, &quot;male&quot;))) fit1 &lt;- brm(data = dat, family = gaussian, height ~ weight + age + I(age^2) + male, prior = c(prior(normal(0, 100), class = Intercept), # set for all &quot;b&quot; coefficients prior(normal(0, 10), class = b), prior(gamma(1, 0.01), class = sigma)), iter = 20000, warmup = 18000, chains = 4, cores = 4, #instructions on MCMC seed = 123, # random number seed to make results reproducible silent = 2, refresh = 0) # saveRDS(fit1, &quot;data/chap7_reg_example&quot;) Summarizing posterior results ## Family: gaussian ## Links: mu = identity; sigma = identity ## Formula: height ~ weight + age + I(age^2) + male ## Data: dat (Number of observations: 544) ## Draws: 4 chains, each with iter = 20000; warmup = 18000; thin = 1; ## total post-warmup draws = 8000 ## ## Population-Level Effects: ## Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS ## Intercept 75.53 1.01 73.52 77.50 1.00 8716 6882 ## weight 1.26 0.06 1.15 1.37 1.00 3406 4486 ## age 1.06 0.11 0.84 1.29 1.00 3169 4137 ## IageE2 -0.01 0.00 -0.01 -0.01 1.00 3297 4224 ## malemale 1.86 0.80 0.33 3.41 1.00 5375 4740 ## ## Family Specific Parameters: ## Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS ## sigma 8.70 0.27 8.20 9.23 1.00 6501 5373 ## ## Draws were sampled using sampling(NUTS).

The estimated \\(R^2\\) is about 0.9. Really good! About 90% of the variance on height is explained by our model. bayes_R2(fit1) ## Estimate Est.Error Q2.5 Q97.5 ## R2 0.9010756 0.002608764 0.8953755 0.9055377 predictive intervals predicting height for a female, 33 years of age and weighting 60kg ind_predic &lt;- posterior_predict(fit1, newdata = data.frame(weight = 60, age = 33, male = &quot;female&quot;)) # mean of the predicted heights mean(ind_predic) ## [1] 174.3464 # Construct a 95% posterior credible interval posterior_interval(ind_predic, prob = 0.95) ## 2.5% 97.5% ## [1,] 157.0509 191.5679 # Posterior predictive probability of height &gt; 164 sum(ind_predic&gt;164)/length(ind_predic) ## [1] 0.88075 6.1.3 Model diagnostics Geweke index and R-hat (Geweke et al. 1991) to check for MCMC convergence modelposterior&lt;- as_draws_matrix(fit1) geweke.diag(modelposterior) ## ## Fraction in 1st window = 0.1 ## Fraction in 2nd window = 0.5 ## ## b_Intercept b_weight b_age b_IageE2 b_malemale sigma ## 1.10099 -0.36665 0.04242 -0.04991 -0.05772 -0.37171 ## lp__ ## 1.16552 Posterior predictive graphic check for model fit A good Bayesian model produces posterior predicted sets of response values with features similar to the original data. It appears our model can be improved! One suggestion is to fit a non-linear term for weight variable. sometime, people also consider data transformation, e.g., log(height) we can also try using student-t distribution not normal distribution to fit the mean! the observed min and max height is not covered in our posterior predictive samples pp_check(fit1, ndraws = 50) pp_check(fit1, type = &quot;stat_2d&quot;, stat = c(&quot;max&quot;, &quot;min&quot;)) Residual plot by continuous variables - checking for linearity assumption res_df &lt;- fit1$data %&gt;% mutate(predict_y = predict(fit1)[ , &quot;Estimate&quot;], std_resid = residuals(fit1, type = &quot;pearson&quot;)[ , &quot;Estimate&quot;]) ggplot(res_df, aes(predict_y, std_resid)) + labs(y=&quot;Standardized residuals&quot;) + geom_point(size = 0.8) + stat_smooth(se = FALSE) + theme_bw() multicollinearity If some coefficients are particularly strongly correlated, you may need to think about using a stronger prior or combining some predictors. pairs(fit1, pars = &quot;b&quot;, off_diag_args = # arguments of the scatterplots list(size = 0.5, # point size alpha = 0.25)) # transparency 6.1.4 Model comparision Watanabe-Akaike Information Criteria (WAIC) WAIC (Watanabe and Opper 2010) is an alternative approach to DIC in estimating the expected log point-wise predictive density The smaller the better! WAIC incorporates prior information, and the use of point-wise likelihood makes it more robust when the posterior distributions deviate from normality. In general, WAIC is a better estimate of the out-of-sample deviance than AIC and DIC. In R under brms package we can use waic() function to obtain WAIC. Bayesian Leave-one-out cross-validation The idea of cross-validation is to split the sample so that it imitates the scenario of estimating the parameters in part of the data and predicting the remaining part. data that are used for estimation is called the training set, and data that are used for prediction is called the validation set. Leave-one-out information criteria (LOO-IC) based on posterior predictive distribution means that one uses \\(n-1\\) observations as the training set and 1 observation as the validation sample, repeat the process \\(n\\) times so that each time a different observation is being predicted LOO-IC requires fitting the model \\(n\\) times, it is generally very computational intensive WAIC can be treated as a fast approximation of LOO-IC, although LOO-IC is more robust and will be a better estimate of out-of-sample deviance In R under brms package we can use loo() function to obtain LOO-IC.

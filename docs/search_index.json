After a thorough review of fundamental concepts in statistics and probability, an introduction will be given to the fundamentals of the Bayesian approach. Students will learn how to use the brms package in the R statistical software environment to carry out Bayesian analyses of data commonly seen in health sciences. Bayesian methods will be covered for binary, continuous and count outcomes in one and two samples, for logistic, linear and Poisson regression, and for meta-analysis. By the end of this course, students will: Understand what is meant by a Bayesian Analysis and how it differs from a typical analysis under the frequentist framework Understand how modern Bayesian models are fitted Understand the role of prior(s) in Bayesian analysis and how to use prior(s) Be able to fit Bayesian models to common types of study outcomes know what aspects of the Bayesian analysis are an essential part of a statistical report Have developed expertise in using the brms program within the R environment Pre-requisites HAD5316H  Biostatistics II: Advanced Techniques in Applied Regression Methods (or CHL5202H Biostatistics II) and basic programming knowledge in R or SAS.

Thomas Bayes was a Presbyterian Minister who is thought to have been born in 1701 and died 1761. Bayesian approach were never really practiced in Bayes lifetime. His work was developed and popularized by Pierre-Simon Laplace (17491827) in the early 19th century. Though Bayes developed his philosophy during the 1740s, it wasnt until the late twentieth century that this work reached a broad audience. During the more than two centuries in between, the frequentist philosophy dominated statistical research and practice. Frequentist ideas came to predominate in the 20th century as a result of the work of Fisher (1890-1962), Neyman (1894-1981) and Egon Pearson (1984-1980). Reasons why the Bayesian approach did not catch on until relatively recently: debate of Bayesian philosophy and computational power. Bayes rule by Bayes He essentially used probabilistic terms to express arguments about the uncertainty for the parameter of a binomial model Given the number of times in which an unknown event has happened and failed: Required the chance that the probability of its happening in a single trial lies somewhere between any two degrees of probability that can be named. unknown event = e.g., Bernoulli trial probability of its happening in a single trial \\(=p\\) We may know ahead of time, or not (e.g. \\(p=0.5\\) for a fair coin) The Monty Hall Problem and the Bayesian solution by Marilyn vos Savant Suppose youre on a game show, and youre given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows whats behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, Do you want to pick door No. 2? Is it to your advantage to switch your choice? From wikipedia, Vos Savants response was that the contestant should switch to the other door. Many readers of vos Savants column refused to believe switching is beneficial and rejected her explanation. After the problem appeared in Parade, approximately 10,000 readers, including nearly 1,000 with PhDs, wrote to the magazine, most of them calling vos Savant wrong (Tierney 1991). We will revisit this problem in session 2 on Probability. I provided a short R simulation below to demonstrate why the player should choose to switch door - higher chance of winning the game. Monty Hall simulation in R set.seed(890123) monty &lt;- function(switch=F) { doors &lt;- sample(c(&#39;car&#39;, &#39;goat&#39;, &#39;goat&#39;), size=3, replace = FALSE) pick &lt;- sample(1:3, size=1, replace = FALSE) #randomly pick 1 door out of the three doors; # Using logic true or false to determine a win; if (switch==T) { # if you chose to switch, you win if the car is not behind the picked door; win &lt;- ifelse(doors[pick] != &#39;car&#39;, 1, 0) } else { # if you chose not to switch, you win if the car is behind the picked door; win &lt;- ifelse(doors[pick] == &#39;car&#39;, 1, 0) } return(win) #return the winning outcome for each game; } # run the game for 1000 iterations; # and record a vector of winning status for not switch and switch; no_switch_win &lt;- sapply(1:1000, FUN=function(i) monty(switch=F)) switch_win &lt;- sapply(1:1000, FUN=function(i) monty(switch=T)) print(paste(&quot;Chance of winning if we always not switch: &quot;, sum(no_switch_win)/1000)) ## [1] &quot;Chance of winning if we always not switch: 0.37&quot; print(paste(&quot;Chance of winning if we always switch: &quot;, sum(switch_win)/1000)) ## [1] &quot;Chance of winning if we always switch: 0.668&quot; The recent rise in popularity Advances in computing Re-evaluation of subjectivity of Bayesian approach due to its use of priors Key discussion on subjectivity by Gelman (Gelman and Hennig 2017) In discussions of the foundations of statistics, objectivity and subjectivity are seen as opposites. Objectivity is typically seen as a good thing; many see it as a major requirement for good science. Bayesian statistics is often presented as being subjective because of the choice of a prior distribution. It has been argued that the subjectiveobjective distinction is meaningless because all statistical methods, Bayesian or otherwise, require subjective choices, but the choice of prior distribution is sometimes held to be particularly subjective because, unlike the data model, it cannot be determined even in the asymptotic limit. 1.3.2 History of this course Prof. George Tomlinson created this course back in 2004 He taught this course from 2004 to 2017 and again from 2020 to 2021. Prof. Nicholas Mitsakakis taught it in 2019. This is my first time teaching this course. We are making history together =) I have borrowed a lot of course materials from George. Thank you George! Juan Pablo will be our guest lecturer this year! 1.4 Thinking like a Bayesian using the concept of probability 1.4.1 Probability is not unitary Mathematically probability is clearly defined (a quantity between 0 and 1 etc., we will talk about this in session 2) There are a few ways of interpreting probability, most notably, long run relative frequency and subjective probability. 1. Long run relative frequency The classical or frequentist way of interpreting probability is based on the proportion of times an outcome occurs in a large (i.e. approaching infinity) number of repetitions of an experiment. This view has various serious problems, including that it requires the outcome to be observable and the experiment to be indeed repeatable! 2. Subjective probability The alternative way (essentially proposed by Bayes, LaPlace, other later prominent Bayesians) is the subjective probability. It encompasses ones views, opinions or beliefs about an event or statement. This event does not have to be repeatable or the outcome observable. It is based on belief. Using this approach, we can express the uncertainty around parameters using probability distributions (e.g., beta distribution for the risk \\(\\theta\\) of death after an operation) Example from (Johnson, Ott, and Dogucu, n.d.) Different interpretation of probability/uncertainty When flipping a fair coin, we say that the probability of flipping Heads is 0.5. How do you interpret this probability? If I flip this coin over and over, roughly 50% will be Heads. Heads and Tails are equally plausible. Both a and b make sense. An election is coming up and a pollster claims that candidate A has a 0.6 probability of winning. How do you interpret this probability? If we observe the election over and over, candidate A will win roughly 60% of the time. Candidate A is much more likely to win than to lose. The pollsters calculation is wrong. Candidate A will either win or lose, thus their probability of winning can only be 0 or 1. In the coin flip example, a Bayesian would conclude that Heads and Tails are equally likely. In contrast, a frequentist would conclude that if we flip the coin over and over and over, roughly 1/2 of these flips will be Heads. 1.4.2 Bayes Rule Bayes rule specifies how a prior probability \\(P(H)\\) of event \\(H\\) is updated in response to the evidence/data \\(E\\) to obtain the posterior probability \\(P(H|E)\\). \\[ P(H|E) = \\frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \\] Event \\(H\\) represents a particular hypothesis1 (or model or parameter) Event \\(E\\) represents observed evidence (or data or information) \\(P(H)\\) is the unconditional or prior probability of \\(H\\) (prior to observing \\(E\\)) \\(P(H|E)\\) is the conditional or posterior probability of \\(H\\) after observing evidence \\(E\\). \\(P(E|H)\\) is the likelihood of evidence \\(E\\) given hypothesis (or model or parameter) \\(H\\) The Bayesian approach provides a probability of the hypothesis given the data/evidence, which is something generally highly desirable from a scientific perspective. 1.4.3 The Scientific Method in steps Define the question or problem Assess the currently available information decide whether it is sufficient or not 2.1 If yes: conclusions, decisions, actions 2.2 If no, proceed to step 3. Determine what additional information is needed and design a study or experiment to obtain it Carry out the study designed in step 3. Use the data obtained in step 4 to update what was previously known. Return to step 2. Bayesian Advantages: Bayesian methods are especially good in step 2 and 5 They can be used for representing well existing knowledge and also to explicitly update uncertainty using new evidence. This is a done in a coherent, natural way. The ELISA test for HIV was widely used in the mid-1990s for screening blood donations. As with most medical diagnostic tests, the ELISA test is not perfect. If a person actually carries the HIV virus, experts estimate that this test gives a positive result 97.7% of the time. (This number is called the sensitivity of the test.) If a person does not carry the HIV virus, ELISA gives a negative (correct) result 92.6% of the time (the specificity of the test). Assume the estimated HIV prevalence at the time was 0.5% of (the prior base rate). Suppose a randomly selected individual tested positive: If we know the likelihood of getting a positive test if HIV is truly present, \\(P(T^+ \\mid D^+) = 0.977\\), and the likelihood of getting a positive test if HIV is not present, \\(P(T^+ \\mid D^-) = 1 - 0.926 = 0.074\\), Using the Bayes Rule, we can calculate the posterior probability of the disease given the result, \\(P(D^+ \\mid T^+)\\) \\[\\begin{aligned} P(D^+ \\mid T^+) &amp; = \\frac{\\text{Chance of HIV positive and test positive}}{\\text{Chance of test positive}}\\\\ &amp; = \\frac{P(D^+ \\text{and } T^+)}{P(T^+)} \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{P(T^+ \\mid D^+)P(D^+)}{P(T^+)} \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{P(T^+ \\mid D^+)P(D^+)}{P(T^+ \\mid D^+)P(D^+) + P(T^+ \\mid D^-)P(D^-)} \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{0.977*0.005}{0.977*0.005 + 0.074*0.995} = \\frac{0.0049}{0.0785} = 0.0622 \\end{aligned}\\] We will review probability rules in session 2 in details. Demonstrate calculation in R library(tidyverse) hypothesis = c(&quot;Carries HIV&quot;, &quot;Does not carry HIV&quot;) prior = c(0.005, 1 - 0.005) likelihood = c(0.977, 1 - 0.926) # given positive test product = prior * likelihood posterior = product / sum(product) bayes_table = data.frame(hypothesis, prior, likelihood, product, posterior) %&gt;% add_row(hypothesis = &quot;Sum&quot;, prior = sum(prior), likelihood = NA, product = sum(product), posterior = sum(posterior)) knitr::kable(bayes_table, digits = 4, align = &#39;r&#39;) hypothesis prior likelihood product posterior Carries HIV 0.005 0.977 0.0049 0.0622 Does not carry HIV 0.995 0.074 0.0736 0.9378 Sum 1.000 NA 0.0785 1.0000 To summarize conceptually we have some belief about the state of the world, expressed as a mathematical model (such as the linear model used in regression). The Bayesian approach provides an updated belief as a weighted combination of prior beliefs regarding that state and the currently available evidence, with the possibility of the current evidence overwhelming prior beliefs, or prior beliefs remaining largely intact in the face of scant evidence. \\[ \\text{updated belief} = \\text{current evidence} \\times \\text{prior belief or evidence} \\] References "],["lab1-getting-started-with-r-rstudio.html", "Lab1 Getting started with R &amp; RStudio 1.5 R and RStudio Installation 1.6 R Packages 1.7 Working in RStudio 1.8 Basic R (a crash introduction)", " Lab1 Getting started with R &amp; RStudio Successfully install R and RStudio Install tidyverse and brms Try out some base R code Play with data frame and produce some summary statistics Learn about Rmarkdown with live demo by Juan Pablo 1.5 R and RStudio Installation R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics (https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html). Many users of R like a tool called RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/). This software is what is called an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R. It has several nice features, including docked windows for your console and syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting and workspace management. 1.5.1 Windows operating system install R, https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/ install RStudio, https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download YouTube Instruction 1.5.2 macOS operating system install R, https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/ install RStudio, https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download (select macOS 10.14+ option) YouTube Instruction 1.6 R Packages Packages are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include reusable R functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data.(Wickham 2015) To load the functions in a given package, we first have to install the package. We do this using the install.packages() function. Run the line of code that installs the tidyverse package below by removing the # at the start of the second line to uncomment the code. R will install the package to a default directory on your computer. If any dialogue box prompts you to set up a personal library instead, click yes. Once we have the package installed, we must load the functions from this library so we can use them within R. # install.packages(tidyverse, dependencies = T) #uncomment this line if you haven&#39;t installed this package; library(tidyverse) # load package library The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures (https://www.tidyverse.org/). The core packages are ggplot2 (data visualization), dplyr(dataframe manipulation), tidyr(data reshaping), readr(reading datasets), purrr (function and iterations) and tibble(dataframe). 1.6.1 Bayesian Analysis in R using brms package The course will mainly use the brms package in R(Bürkner 2017), which offers a standard R-modelling type interface to the underlying computing engine Stan. Direct use of Stan is not ideal for teaching Bayesian methods. The brms package automatically writes Stan code that can be viewed and edited, so after learning brms, the enterprising student may want to use this Stan code as a steppingstone toward programming directly in Stan. The brms package can be installed and loaded in the same way as any other R package, in this case by typing the following commands in R: #uncomment this line if you haven&#39;t installed this package; # install.packages(brms) library(brms) 1.7 Working in RStudio 1.7.1 RStudio layout When you open RStudio, your interface is made up of four panes as shown below. These can be organised via menu options View &gt; Panes &gt; RStudio layout We can run code in the console at the prompt where R will evaluate it and print the results. However, the best practice is to write your code in a new script file so it can be saved, edited, and reproduced. To open a new script, we select File &gt; New File &gt; R Script. To run code that was written in the script file, you can highlight the code lines you wish be evaluated and press CTRL-Enter (windows) or Cmd+Return (Mac). Additionally, You can comment or uncomment script lines by pressing Ctrl+Shift+C (windows) or Cmd+Shift+C (Mac). The comment operator in R is #. You can find more RStuio default keyboard shortcuts here. In our first tutorial, we will also introduce Rmarkdown, a R version of the markdown file editor that can write and output document in html, word, or pdf format that contents not only the programming code but also any evaluation outputs and graphs. To read more about Rmarkdown, please visit https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html. 1.7.2 Customization You can customize your RStudio session under the Options dialog Tools &gt; Global Options menu (or RStudio &gt; Preferences on a Mac). A list of customization categories can be found here, https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200549016-Customizing-RStudio. For example, its popular to change RStudio appearance and themes (e.g., mordern, sky, dark, and classic). 1.7.3 Working directory The working directory is the default location where R will look for files you want to load and where it will put any files you save. You can use function getwd() to display your current working directory and use function setwd() to set your workding directory to a new folder on your computer. One of the great things about using RStudio Projects is that when you open a project it will automatically set your working directory to the appropriate location. getwd() #show my current working directory; ## [1] &quot;D:/GitHub/bayes_bookdown&quot; 1.7.4 Getting help with R The help section of R is extremely useful if you need more information about the packages and functions that you are currently loaded. You can initiate R help using the help function help() or ?, the help operator. help(brms) 1.8 Basic R (a crash introduction) A more comprehensive introduction to base R can be found at https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html. In this subsection, I will briefly outline some common R functions and commands for arithmetic, creating and working with object, vector, matrix, and data. This short introduction is created using the intro to R workshop notes by Prof. Kevin Thorpe as well as multiple open-source materials. Some important notes R is case sensitive. Commands are separated by a newline in the console. The # character can be used to make comments. R doesnt execute the rest of the line after the # symbol - it ignores it. Previous session commands can be accessed via the up and down arrow keys on the keyboard.

Review on random variables and common probability distributions Probability Terminology 2.1 Probability Probability has a central place in Bayesian analysis we put a prior probability distribution on the unknowns (parameters), we model the observed data with a probability distribution (likelihood), and we combine the two into a posterior probability distribution Probability Terminology(Evans and Rosenthal 2004) Sample space This set of all possible outcomes of an experiment/trial is known as the sample space of the experiment/trial and is denoted by \\(S\\) or \\(\\Omega\\). Experiment/Trial: each occasion we observe a random phenomenon that we know what outcomes can occur, but we do not know which outcome will occur Event: Any subset of the sample space \\(S\\) is known as an event, denoted by \\(A\\). Note that, \\(A\\) is also a collection of one or more outcomes. Probability defined on events: For each event \\(A\\) of the sample space \\(S\\), \\(P(A)\\), the probability of the event \\(A\\), satisfies the following three conditions: \\(0 \\leq P(A) \\leq 1\\) \\(P(S) = 1\\) and \\(P(\\emptyset) = 0\\); \\(\\emptyset\\) denotes the empty set \\(P\\) is (countably) additive, meaning that if \\(A_1, A_2, \\ldots\\) is a finite or countable sequence of disjoint (also known as mutually exclusive events), then \\[P(A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup \\ldots ) = P(A_1)+P(A_2)+\\ldots \\] Union: Denote the event that either \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) occurs as \\(A\\cup B\\). Intersection: Denote the event that both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) occur as \\(A\\cap B\\) Complement: Denote the event that \\(A\\) does not occur as \\(\\bar{A}\\) or \\(A^{C}\\) or \\(A^\\prime\\) (different people use different notations) Disjoint (or mutually exclusive): Two events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are said to be disjoint if the occurrence of one event precludes the occurrence of the other. If two events are mutually exclusive, then \\(P(A\\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)\\) Sample Space If the experiment consists of the flipping of a coin, then \\[ S = \\{H, T\\}\\] If the experiment consists of rolling a die, then the sample space is \\[ S = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\] If the experiments consists of flipping two coins, then the sample space consists of the following four points: \\[ S = \\{(H,H), (H,T), (T,H), (T,T)\\}\\] Event In Example (1), if E = {H}, then E is the event that a head appears on the flip of the coin. Similarly, if \\(E = \\{T \\}\\), then \\(E\\) would be the event that a tail appears In Example (2), if \\(E = \\{1\\}\\), then \\(E\\) is the event that one appears on the roll of the die. If \\(E = \\{2, 4, 6\\}\\), then \\(E\\) would be the event that an even number appears on the roll. In Example (3), if \\(E = \\{(H, H), (H, T )\\}\\), then \\(E\\) is the event that a head appears on the first coin. Probability of an event. Let \\(R\\) be the sum of two standard dice. Suppose we are interested in \\(P(R \\le 4)\\). Notice that the pair of dice can fall 36 different ways (6 ways for the first die and six for the second results in 6x6 possible outcomes, and each way has equal probability \\(1/36\\). \\[\\begin{aligned} P(R \\le 4 ) &amp;= P(R=2)+P(R=3)+P(R=4) \\\\ &amp;= P(\\left\\{ 1,1\\right\\} )+P(\\left\\{ 1,2\\right\\} \\mathrm{\\textrm{ or }}\\left\\{ 2,1\\right\\} )+P(\\{1,3\\}\\textrm{ or }\\{2,2\\}\\textrm{ or }\\{3,1\\}) \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{36}+\\frac{2}{36}+\\frac{3}{36} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{6}{36} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{6} \\end{aligned}\\] 2.1.1 Venn Diagrams Venn diagrams provide a very useful graphical method for depicting the sample space S and subsets of it. Figure taken from (Cardinal 2019). Figure 2.1: Venn Diagram for two events Venn Diagram for two disjoint events How would you draw this venn diagram? Label sub-regions in a Venn Diagram for three events Using set theory, how would you write out areas a, d, and f ? A &lt;- c(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;, &quot;d&quot;,&quot;e&quot;) B &lt;- c(&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;,&quot;f&quot;) C &lt;- c(&quot;d&quot;,&quot;e&quot;,&quot;f&quot;,&quot;g&quot;) x &lt;- list(A=A , B=B , C=C) v0 &lt;- venn.diagram( x, filename=NULL, fill = c(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;green&quot;), alpha = 0.50, col = &quot;transparent&quot;) overlaps &lt;- calculate.overlap(x) # extract indexes of overlaps from list names indx &lt;- as.numeric(substr(names(overlaps),2,2)) # labels start at position 7 in the list for Venn&#39;s with 3 circles for (i in 1:length(overlaps)){ v0[[6 + indx[i] ]]$label &lt;- paste(overlaps[[i]], collapse = &quot;\\n&quot;) } grid.draw(v0) 2.1.2 Probability Rules General Addition Rule: \\(P(A\\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\\cap B)\\) The reason behind this fact is that if there is if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are not disjoint, then some area is added twice when we calculate \\(P\\left(A\\right)+P\\left(B\\right)\\). To account for this, we simply subtract off the area that was double counted. Complement Rule: \\(P(A)+P(A^c)=1\\) This rule follows from the partitioning of the set of all events (\\(S\\)) into two disjoint sets, \\(A\\) and \\(A^c\\). We learned above that \\(A \\cup A^c = S\\) and that \\(P(S) = 1\\). Combining those statements, we obtain the complement rule. Completeness Rule: \\(P(A)=P(A\\cap B)+P(A\\cap B^c)\\) This identity is just breaking the event \\(A\\) into two disjoint pieces. Law of total probability (unconditioned version): Let \\(A_1, A_2, \\ldots\\) be events that form a partition of the sample space \\(S\\), Let \\(B\\) be any event. Then, \\[P(B) = P(A_1 \\cap B) + P(A_2 \\cap B) + \\ldots. \\] This law is key in deriving the marginal event probability in Bayes rule. Recall the HIV example from session 1, we have \\(P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap D^+)+P(T^+ \\cap D^-)\\). Figure 2.2: Demonstrate Law of total probabiliy using Venn Diagram Conditional Probability: In general we define conditional probability (assuming \\(P(B) \\ne 0\\)) as \\[P(A|B)=\\frac{P(A\\cap B)}{P(B)}\\] which can also be rearranged to show \\[\\begin{aligned} P(A\\cap B) &amp;= P(A\\,|\\,B)\\,P(B) \\\\ &amp;= P(B\\,|\\,A)\\,P(A) \\end{aligned}\\] Because the order doesnt matter and \\(P\\left(A\\cap B\\right)=P\\left(B\\cap A\\right)\\). Independent: Two events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are said to be independent if \\(P(A\\cap B)=P(A)P(B)\\). What independence is saying that knowing the outcome of event \\(A\\) doesnt give you any information about the outcome of event \\(B\\). If \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are independent events, then \\(P(A|B) = P(A)\\) and \\(P(B|A) = P(B)\\). In simple random sampling, we assume that any two samples are independent. In cluster sampling, we assume that samples within a cluster are not independent, but clusters are independent of each other. Bayes Rule: This arises naturally from the rule on conditional probability. Since the order does not matter in \\(A \\cap B\\), we can rewrite the equation: \\[\\begin{aligned} P(A \\cap B) &amp;= P(B \\cap A) \\\\ P(A\\mid B)P(B) &amp;= P(B\\mid A)P(A) \\\\ P(A\\mid B) &amp;= \\frac{P(B\\mid A)P(A) }{P(B)}\\\\ &amp;= \\frac{P(B\\mid A)P(A) }{P(B\\mid A)P(A) + P(B\\mid A^C)P(A^C)} \\end{aligned}\\] 2.1.3 How to define and assign probabilities in general? Frequency-type (Empirical Probability): based on the idea of frequency or long-run frequency of an event. Observe sequence of coin tosses (trials) and the count number of times of event \\(A=\\{H\\}\\). The relative frequency of \\(A\\) is given as, \\[ P(A) = \\frac{\\text{Number of times A occurs}}{\\text{Total number of trials}}. \\] Trials are independent. Relative frequency is unpredictable in short-term, but in long-run its predicable. Let \\(n\\) be the total number of trials and \\(m\\) be number of heads, then we have \\[ P(A) = \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{m}{n}.\\] Theoretical Probability: Sometimes \\(P(A)\\) can be deduced from mathematical model using uniform probability property on finite spaces. If the sample space S is finite, then one possible probability measure on \\(S\\) is the uniform probability measure, which assigns probability \\(1/|S|\\), equal probability to each outcome. Here |S| is the number of elements in the sample space \\(S\\). By additivity, it then follows that for any event \\(A\\) we have, \\[ P(A) = \\frac{|A|}{|S|} = \\frac{\\text{Number of outcomes in S that satisfy A}}{\\text{Total number of outcomes in S} } \\] Long-term frequency It is natural to think of large sequences of similar events defining frequency-type probability if we allow the number of trials to be indefinitely large. Figure 2.3: Demonstrate law of large number with the coin tossing example Belief-type (Subjective Probability): based on the idea of degree of belief (weight of evidence) about an event where the scale is anchored at certain (=1) and impossible (=0). Subjective Probability Consider these events We will have more than 100cm of snow this winter. An asteroid is responsible for the extinction of the dinosaurs Mammography reduces the rate of death from breast cancer in women over 50 by more than 10% The 70 year old man in your office, just diagnosed with lung cancer, will live at least 5 years Can you think of them in terms of long-run frequencies? We cannot always think in terms of long-run frequencies Also, we may not care about long-run frequencies How are they relevant to this patient, this hypothesis? Even where long-run frequency could apply, often there is no such data available However, opinions are formed and beliefs exist Which probability to use? For inference, the Bayesian approach relies mainly on the belief interpretation of probability. The laws of probability can be derived from some basic axioms that do not rely on long-run frequencies. The Monty Hall Problem Revisit Suppose youre on a game show, and youre given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows whats behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, Do you want to pick door No. 2? Is it to your advantage to switch your choice? Before any door is picked, we assume all three doors are equal likely to have a car behind it (prior probability of 1/3). Without loss of generality, let assume we pick door 1 and Monty opens door 2 (goat behind). \\(P( \\text{door 1 has car}) = P( \\text{door 2 has car}) = P( \\text{door 3 has car)} = \\frac{1}{3}\\) \\(P( \\text{Monty opens door 2} \\mid \\text{door 1 has car} ) = \\frac{1}{2}\\) \\(P( \\text{Monty opens door 2} \\mid \\text{door 2 has car} ) = 0\\) \\(P( \\text{Monty opens door 2} \\mid \\text{door 3 has car} ) = 1\\) We want to know these two probabilities: \\(P( \\text{door 1 has car} \\mid \\text{Monty opens door 2} )\\) and \\(P( \\text{door 3 has car} \\mid \\text{Monty opens door 2} )\\). Simplify notations, we have \\[\\begin{aligned} &amp; P( D_1 = \\text{car} \\mid \\text{open } D_2 ) \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{P( \\text{open } D_2 \\mid D_1 = \\text{car} )P(D_1 = \\text{car})}{P(\\text{open } D_2)} \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{P( \\text{open } D_2 \\mid D_1 = \\text{car} )P(D_1 = \\text{car})}{P( \\text{open } D_2 \\mid D_1 = \\text{car} )P(D_1 = \\text{car}) + P(\\text{open } D_2 \\mid D_3 = \\text{car})P(D_3 = \\text{car})} \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3}}{\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3} + 1 \\times \\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\end{aligned}\\] \\[\\begin{aligned} &amp; P( D_3 = \\text{car} \\mid \\text{open } D_2 ) \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{P( \\text{open } D_2 \\mid D_3 = \\text{car} )P(D_3 = \\text{car})}{P(\\text{open } D_2)} \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{P( \\text{open } D_2 \\mid D_3 = \\text{car} )P(D_3 = \\text{car})}{P( \\text{open } D_2 \\mid D_3 = \\text{car} )P(D_3 = \\text{car}) + P(\\text{open } D_2 \\mid D_1 = \\text{car})P(D_1 = \\text{car})} \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{ 1 \\times \\frac{1}{3}}{ 1 \\times \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{2}{3} \\end{aligned}\\] Given we pick door 1 and Monty opens door 2 (goat behind), the probability of the car behind door 1 is 1/3 while the probability of the car behind door 3 is 2/3. Therefore, we should switch to door 3 for a better chance of winning. The ELISA test Problem Revisit The ELISA test for HIV was widely used in the mid-1990s for screening blood donations. As with most medical diagnostic tests, the ELISA test is not perfect. If a person actually carries the HIV virus, experts estimate that this test gives a positive result 97.7% of the time. (This number is called the sensitivity of the test.) If a person does not carry the HIV virus, ELISA gives a negative (correct) result 92.6% of the time (the specificity of the test). Assume the estimated HIV prevalence at the time was 0.5% of (the prior base rate). Suppose a randomly selected individual tested positive, please calculate \\(P(D^+ \\mid T^+)\\) and \\(P(D^- \\mid T^-)\\). 2.2 Random Variables The different types of probability distributions (and therefore your analysis method) can be divided into two general classes: Continuous Random Variables - the variable takes on numerical values and could, in principle, take any of an uncountable number of values. 2.Discrete Random Variables - the variable takes on one of small set of values (or only a countable number of outcomes). 2.3 R Quick Reference We give a brief summary of the distributions used most in this course and the abbreviations used in R. Distribution Stem Parameters Parameter Interpretation Binomial binom size prob Number of Trials, Probability of Success (per Trial) Exponential exp rate Mean of the distribution Normal norm mean=0 sd=1 Center of the distribution, Standard deviation Uniform unif min=0 max=1 Minimum and Maximum of the distribution All the probability distributions available in R are accessed in exactly the same way, using a d-function, p-function, q-function, and r-function.

These functions are named by just adding an x at the beginning of the function. For example mosaic::xpnorm(-1).

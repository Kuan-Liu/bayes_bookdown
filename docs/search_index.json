Priors with information on values of parameters, informative priors Priors that charaterize personal/expert opinion Prior elicitation Historical data or past evidence Default priors in clincial studies Informative priors used for computational efficiency and variable selection objective and non-informative priors Flat prior, vague prior, and weakly-informative priors Important consideration before choosing a prior Choice of prior does affect the posterior, however, prior is only one part of Bayesian modelling. Prior is not unique and there is no one correct prior distribution! In many situations with large sample sizes, the posterior distribution is not too sensitive to reasonable changes in prior. When working with rare outcomes (e.g., small disease cohort), changes in prior distribution can influence posterior distribution One criticism of Bayesian inference is in its incorporation of priors, which is considered as a subjective modelling choice. However, any statistical analysis is inherently subjective, frequentist or Bayesian. Subjective choice of prior can often be beneficial Sensitivity analysis is crucial in assessing the impact of particular distributions on the conclusions. when we are working with small samples, informative prior allows us to explicitly incorporate past evidence and expert knowledge we can also use sparsity promoting prior (i.e., shrinkage prior) to reduce the number of parameters to be estimated to improve estimation efficiency and avoid over-fitting 4.1.1 Eliciting priors from experts Reference reading on expert elicitation: OHagan, A., Buck, C.E., Daneshkhah, A., Eiser, J.R., Garthwaite, P.H., Jenkinson, D.J., Oakley, J.E. and Rakow, T., 2006. Uncertain judgements: eliciting experts probabilities. (OHagan et al. 2006) Elicitation is the process of representing the knowledge of one or more experts - expert knowledge is useful! concerning an uncertain quantity as a probability distribution for that quantity (i.e. as a random variable with some distribution) Good elicitation methods are formal, statistically rigorous, and use carefully considered probabilistic judgement techniques in practice, elicitation follows pre-developed elicitation protocol elicitation process often involve training and discussion between experts and statisticians to eliminate bias, mis-interpretation, over-optimistic thinking  Aggregating expert judgement There are two general approaches to summarizing the estimates from the experts. Aggregate the distributions Elicit a distribution from each expert separately Combine these multiple distribution using mathematical aggregation, also called pooling Aggregate the experts gather expert belief and elicit a single distribution, also called behavioural aggregation. Three protocols/frameworks Most popular. Sheffield Elicitation Framework (SHELF). The SHELF protocol is a behavioral aggregation method that uses two rounds of judgments. (OHagan et al. 2006) In the first round, individuals make private judgements In the second round, those judgments are reviewed before the group agrees on consensus judgement. SHELF documentation and software: http://www.jeremy-oakley.staff.shef.ac.uk/shelf/software/ Dr. Anthony OHagans talk on elicitation and SHELF Cooke protocol. A mathematical aggregation approach weights expert responses by their likely accuracy. (Cooke et al. 1991) The likely accuracy is calculated using a seed value. Expert who more accurately predict the seed value are weighted more. Delphi Method The Delphi is similar to SHELF as it is a behavioral aggregation method with two or more rounds except that anonymity is maintained in terms of who gave which answers. unlike SHELF, experts provide their judgments individually with no interaction and a pooling rule is required across expert final distributions.

For thousands of years it has been the traditional land of the Huron-Wendat, the Seneca, and the Mississaugas of the Credit. Today, this meeting place is still the home to many Indigenous people from across Turtle Island and we are grateful to have the opportunity to work on this land.

After a thorough review of fundamental concepts in statistics and probability, an introduction will be given to the fundamentals of the Bayesian approach, including a look at how computer simulation can be used to solve statistical problems. Students will learn how to use the brms package in the R statistical software environment to carry out Bayesian analyses of data commonly seen in health sciences. Bayesian methods will be covered for binary, continuous and count outcomes in one and two samples, for logistic, linear and Poisson regression, and for meta-analysis. By the end of this course, students will: 1 Understand what is meant by a Bayesian Analysis and how it differs from a typical analysis under the frequentist framework 2 Understand the role and importance of Markov Chain Monte Carlo in modern Bayesian methods 3 Understand how modern Bayesian models are fitted 4 Be able to fit Bayesian models to common types of study designs and data types 5 Know what aspects of the Bayesian analysis are an essential part of a statistical report 6 Have worked through some case studies (in lectures, tutorials and as part of assignments) 7 Have developed expertise in using the brms program within the R environment PRE-REQUISITES HAD5316H  Biostatistics II: Advanced Techniques in Applied Regression Methods, Some simple programming (e.g., SAS data step, R, S-Plus)  may be taken concurrently with course. Necessary skills include: installing packages, reading data into R, basic data cleaning in R including basic data manipulation and graphics (e.g., plot or ggplot2). EVALUATION 4 Individual Assignments each worth 25% Course Textbook and Structure TEXTBOOK: 2nd edition of the book by Richard McElreath: https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/ The course will be organized into weekly lectures consisting of a combination of electronic slides and demonstrations. Students are expected to ask and answer questions in class. Classes will contain regular breaks for small group breakouts where small assignments will be given for students to complete together. The idea of these breakouts is to engage with your classmates and work through coding exercises together. Exercises will often be structured in a way that forces your group to go beyond what is included in the class notes and seek help online to figure out how to complete. Students should bring a laptop to in person class and be prepared to follow along with demonstrations and breakout groups. Example assignments are shown below along with the associated core competency. Assignment Competency Properly install software for reproducible research: R, R Studio, homebrew (Mac), Git, text editor (e.g., Notepad++ or Sublime Text), LaTex, GNU make Identify software for the interface of data entry and statistical analysis Build a GitHub repository, tag a release of your code, and write a proper README file Develop public health information systems to support public health efforts Develop an R Markdown document performing a reproducible statistical analysis and summarizing results visually Apply standard statistical methods in the analysis of public health information Assess individual data elements and display results effectively and appropriately Build a Docker container for running a fully reproducible analysis pipeline Develop public health information systems to support public health efforts Execute basic python commands in a Jupyter notebook. Identify software for the interface of data entry and statistical analysis Set up an EC2 instance and S3 bucket on AWS suitable for a reproducible data analysis in the cloud. Develop public health information systems to support public health efforts Accessibility and Accommodations Honor Code You are bound by Emory Universitys Student Honor and Conduct Code. RSPH requires that all material submitted by a student fulfilling his or her academic course of study must be the original work of the student. Violations of academic honor include any action by a student indicating dishonesty or a lack of integrity in academic ethics. Academic dishonesty refers to cheating, plagiarizing, assisting other students without authorization, lying, tampering, or stealing in performing any academic work, and will not be tolerated under any circumstances. The RSPH Honor Code states: Plagiarism is the act of presenting as ones own work the expression, words, or ideas of another person whether published or unpublished (including the work of another student). A writers work should be regarded as his/her own property.

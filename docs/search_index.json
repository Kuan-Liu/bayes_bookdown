For thousands of years it has been the traditional land of the Huron-Wendat, the Seneca, and the Mississaugas of the Credit. Today, this meeting place is still the home to many Indigenous people from across Turtle Island and we are grateful to have the opportunity to work on this land.

Instructors Email Office Hour Kuan Liu (Kuan) mailto:kuan.liu@mail.utoronto.ca Juan Pablo Díaz Martínez (Juan Pablo) mailto:juan.diaz.martinez@mail.utoronto.ca Course Description This course will introduce students to Bayesian data analysis. After a thorough review of fundamental concepts in statistics and probability, an introduction will be given to the fundamentals of the Bayesian approach. Students will learn how to use the brms package in the R statistical software environment to carry out Bayesian analyses of data commonly seen in health sciences. Bayesian methods will be covered for binary, continuous and count outcomes in one and two samples, for logistic, linear and Poisson regression, and for meta-analysis. By the end of this course, students will: Understand what is meant by a Bayesian Analysis and how it differs from a typical analysis under the frequentist framework Understand how modern Bayesian models are fitted Understand the role of prior(s) in Bayesian analysis and how to use prior(s) Be able to fit Bayesian models to common types of study outcomes know what aspects of the Bayesian analysis are an essential part of a statistical report Have developed expertise in using the brms program within the R environment Pre-requisites HAD5316H  Biostatistics II: Advanced Techniques in Applied Regression Methods (or CHL5202H Biostatistics II) and basic programming knowledge in R or SAS. HAD5316H or CHL5202H may be taken concurrently with this course.

This occurs through a collaborative process that acknowledges a collective obligation to develop an accessible learning environment that both meets the needs of students and preserves the essential academic requirements of the Universitys courses and programs.

Academic Integrity Academic integrity is essential to the pursuit of learning and scholarship in a university, and to ensuring that a degree from the University of Toronto is a strong signal of each students individual academic achievement. As a result, the University treats cases of cheating and plagiarism very seriously. Help and information is available on the Academic Integrity website. The University of Torontos Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters (http://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/policies/behaveac.htm) outlines the behaviours that constitute academic dishonesty and the processes for addressing academic offences.

Many users of R like a tool called RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/). This software is what is called an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R. It has several nice features, including docked windows for your console and syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting and workspace management. 1.1.1 Windows operating system install R, https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/ install Rstudio, https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download YouTube Instruction 1.1.2 macOS operating system install R, https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/ install Rstudio, https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download (select macOS 10.14+ option) YouTube Instruction 1.2 R Packages Packages are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include reusable R functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data.(Wickham 2015) To load the functions in a given package, we first have to install the package. We do this using the install.packages() function. Run the line of code that installs the tidyverse package below by removing the # at the start of the second line to uncomment the code. R will install the package to a default directory on your computer. If any dialogue box prompts you to set up a personal library instead, click yes. Once we have the package installed, we must load the functions from this library so we can use them within R. # install.packages(tidyverse, dependencies = T) #uncomment this line if you haven&#39;t installed this package; library(tidyverse) # load package library The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures (https://www.tidyverse.org/). The core packages are ggplot2 (data visualization), dplyr(dataframe manipulation), tidyr(data reshaping), readr(reading datasets), purrr (function and iterations) and tibble(dataframe). 1.2.1 Bayesian Analysis in R using brms package The course will mainly use the brms package in R(Bürkner 2017), which offers a standard R-modelling type interface to the underlying computing engine Stan. Direct use of Stan is not ideal for teaching Bayesian methods. The brms package automatically writes Stan code that can be viewed and edited, so after learning brms, the enterprising student may want to use this Stan code as a steppingstone toward programming directly in Stan. The brms package can be installed and loaded in the same way as any other R package, in this case by typing the following commands in R: # install.packages(brms) #uncomment this line if you haven&#39;t installed this package; library(brms) 1.3 Working in Rstudio 1.3.1 Rstudio layout When you open RStudio, your interface is made up of four panes as shown below. These can be organised via menu options View &gt; Panes &gt; Rstudio layout We can run code in the console at the prompt where R will evaluate it and print the results. However, the best practice is to write your code in a new script file so it can be saved, edited, and reproduced. To open a new script, we select File &gt; New File &gt; R Script. To run code that was written in the script file, you can highlight the code lines you wish be evaluated and press CTRL-Enter (windows) or Cmd+Return (Mac). Additionally, You can comment or uncomment script lines by pressing Ctrl+Shift+C (windows) or Cmd+Shift+C (Mac). The comment operator in R is #. You can find more RStuio default keyboard shortcuts here. In our first tutorial, we will also introduce Rmarkdown, a R version of the markdown file editor that can write and output document in html, word, or pdf format that contents not only the programming code but also any evaluation outputs and graphs. To read more about Rmarkdown, please visit https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html. 1.3.2 Customization You can customize your Rstudio session under the Options dialog Tools &gt; Global Options menu (or RStudio &gt; Preferences on a Mac). A list of customization categories can be found here, https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200549016-Customizing-RStudio. For example, its popular to change Rstudio appearance and themes (e.g., mordern, sky, dark, and classic). 1.3.3 Working directory The working directory is the default location where R will look for files you want to load and where it will put any files you save. You can use function getwd() to display your current working directory and use function setwd() to set your workding directory to a new folder on your computer. One of the great things about using RStudio Projects is that when you open a project it will automatically set your working directory to the appropriate location. getwd() #show my current working directory; ## [1] &quot;D:/GitHub/bayes_bookdown&quot; 1.3.4 Getting help with R The help section of R is extremely useful if you need more information about the packages and functions that you are currently loaded. You can initiate R help using the help function help() or ?, the help operator. 1.4 Basic R (a crash introduction) A more comprehensive introduction to base R can be found at https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html. In this subsection, I will briefly outline some common R functions and commands for arithmetic, creating and working with object, vector, matrix, and data.

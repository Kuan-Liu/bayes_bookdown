Priors with information on values of parameters, informative priors Priors that charaterize personal/expert opinion Prior elicitation Historical data or past evidence Default priors in clincial studies Informative priors used for computational efficiency and variable selection objective and non-informative priors Flat prior, vague prior, and weakly-informative priors Important consideration before choosing a prior Choice of prior does affect the posterior, however, prior is only one part of Bayesian modelling. Prior is not unique and there is no one correct prior distribution! In many situations with large sample sizes, the posterior distribution is not too sensitive to reasonable changes in prior. When working with rare outcomes (e.g., small disease cohort), changes in prior distribution can influence posterior distribution One criticism of Bayesian inference is in its incorporation of priors, which is considered as a subjective modelling choice. However, any statistical analysis is inherently subjective, frequentist or Bayesian. Subjective choice of prior can often be beneficial Sensitivity analysis is crucial in assessing the impact of particular distributions on the conclusions. when we are working with small samples, informative prior allows us to explicitly incorporate past evidence and expert knowledge we can also use sparsity promoting prior (i.e., shrinkage prior) to reduce the number of parameters to be estimated to improve estimation efficiency and avoid over-fitting 4.1.1 Eliciting priors from experts Elicitation is the process of representing the knowledge of one or more experts - expert knowledge is useful! concerning an uncertain quantity as a probability distribution for that quantity (i.e. as a random variable with some distribution) Good elicitation methods are formal, statistically rigorous, and use carefully considered probabilistic judgement techniques in practice, elicitation follows pre-developed elicitation protocol elicitation process often involve training and discussion between experts and statisticians to eliminate bias, mis-interpretation, over-optimistic thinking  Aggregating expert judgement There are two general approaches to summarizing the estimates from the experts. Aggregate the distributions Elicit a distribution from each expert separately Combine these multiple distribution using mathematical aggregation, also called pooling Aggregate the experts gather expert belief and elicit a single distribution, also called behavioural aggregation. Three protocols Most popular. Sheffield Elicitation Framework (SHELF). The SHELF protocol is a behavioral aggregation method that uses two rounds of judgments. (OHagan et al. 2006) In the first round, individuals make private judgements In the second round, those judgments are reviewed before the group agrees on consensus judgement. Cooke protocol. A mathematical aggregation approach weights expert responses by their likely accuracy. (Cooke et al. 1991) The likely accuracy is calculated using a seed value. Expert who more accurately predict the seed value are weighted more. Delphi Method The Delphi is similar to SHELF as it is a behavioral aggregation method with two or more rounds except that anonymity is maintained in terms of who gave which answers. unlike SHELF, experts provide their judgments individually with no interaction and a pooling rule is required across expert final distributions.

Spiegelhalter, Abrams, and Myles 2003) 4.2.1 Non-informative or reference priors (Pros) It is attractive to seek a noninformative prior to use as a baseline analysis such analyses have been suggested as a way of making probability statements about parameters without being explicitly Bayesian (David J. Spiegelhalter 2004) (Cons) However, ninformative priors are nonsensical and can lead to inference problems, especially in smaller samples can have a strong impact particularly when events are rare. Prior Choice Recommendations and Wiki developed by the stan team, https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Prior-Choice-Recommendations this guide is written by statisticians, thus, recommendations are primary for non-informative, vague, and weakly informative priors General principle on this guide provides a start 1. Noninformative Prior on Proportion Suppose you are estimating the 30-day mortality after elective non-cardiac surgery, what is an uninformative prior for the proportion dying? An off the shelf uninformative priors for binomial model are \\(\\theta \\sim U(0,1) \\equiv Beta(1,1)\\) Jeffreys prior, \\(\\theta \\sim Beta(0.5,0.5)\\) Prior median q2.5 q97.5 Pr(\\(\\theta\\)&lt; 0.25) Pr(\\(\\theta\\)&lt; 0.5) Pr(\\(\\theta\\)&lt; 0.75) Beta(1,1) 0.5 0.025 0.975 0.25 0.5 0.75 Beta(0.5,0.5) 0.5 0.002 0.998 0.333 0.5 0.667 2. Noninformative Prior on log-relative risk Suppose you want to estimate the relative risk for death in a clinical trial Relative risk modelling works with the log-relative risk (as it has an approximately normal likelihood) An off the shelf uninformative prior with a large variance might be \\[\\log(RR) = \\theta \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2 = 10^2)\\] Prior 95% Credible Interval for log(RR) is -19.6 to 19.6 Prior 95% Credible Interval for RR is \\(3 \\times 10^{-9}\\) to \\(3 \\times 10^{9}\\) A more sensible choice, \\(N(0,5^2)\\), for log scale OR, RR, and HR. Prior log(RR) median log(RR) q2.5 log(RR) q97.5 log(RR) q2.5 RR q97. RR N(0,100) 0 -19.6 19.6 0.0000000031 325098849.19 N(0,25) 0 -9.8 9.8 0.0000554616 18030.5 N(0,16) 0 -7.84 7.84 0.0003937258 2539.84 N(0,9) 0 -5.88 5.88 0.0027950873 357.77 N(0,4) 0 -3.92 3.92 0.019842524 50.4 N(0,1) 0 -1.96 1.96 0.1408634941 7.1 Quick Summary Posterior could land on implausible values with small numbers of deaths in one group or other. These issues resolve somewhat with larger data sets With a precise likelihood (e.g., large sample size or large number of events), data rescues you from allowing implausible values. 1. ISSUE with Uniform Priors uniform priors on one scale are not uniform on a transformed scale Suppose we set prior \\(\\theta \\sim U(0,1)\\) as an uninformative prior on the parameter quantifying risk of adverse event, probability \\(\\theta\\) Prior distribution on log(\\(\\frac{\\theta}{1-\\theta}\\)), which is also called the logit of \\(\\theta\\) is no longer uniformly distributed 2. Using large variance normal distribution as non-informative prior How is a normal distribution N(0,\\(100^2\\)), with its bell-shape, uninformative? It does not put equal density on all points, as the density drops off from zero in each direction The key is that it is locally uniform In the region where a parameter is likely to lie, the normal distribution is flat. 4.2.2 Minimally informative prior Use substantive knowledge to put most prior weight on possible values, without being too restrictive From example, a RR for mortality in a trial, a prior with most weight on values of 0.66 to 1.5, a N(0,1) prior would be considered suitable. For the between-person standard deviation of a 0-40 quality of life instrument, a prior with most weight on values under 10, a possible prior would be Gamma(0.1,0.1) on the precision. 4.2.3 Skeptical Prior priors that express doubts about large effects Mathematically speaking, a sceptical prior about a treatment effect will have a mean of zero and a shape chosen to include plausible treatment differences which determines the degree of scepticism. This is centred at no effect and a 95% CR extends to a minimally clinically important difference (MCID) Skeptical prior will shrink back observed results towards the null effect If under the skeptical prior, the posterior results support conclusion of effectiveness (results suggest departure from null), the skeptic is convinced! Spiegelhater suggested a reasonable degree of scepticism maybe feeling that the study has been designed around an alternative hypothesis that is optimistic, formalized by a prior with only a small probability say 5% that the effect is as large as the optimistic alternative Example from EOLIA trial(Goligher et al. 2018) MCID for 60-day mortality in RR comparing between ECOMO and Rescue Lung Injury in Severe ARDS is 0.67, log(0.4/0.6) = -0.405. Let P(RR&lt;0.67) = P(log(RR)&lt; -0.405) = 0.05, that is saying the probability of the ECOMO being effective beyond MCID is only 5%, we have \\[1.645 \\times \\sigma = MCID = |-0.405| = 0.405\\] \\[\\sigma = \\frac{0.405}{1.645} = 0.246\\] yielding a candidate skeptical prior on log(RR) ~ \\(N(0,0.245^2)\\) 4.2.4 Optimistic/enthusiastic Prior This is centred at the MCID and a 95% CR extends to no effect Optimistic Prior will move observed results towards the MCID If a optimist is convinced that there is no effect, the evidence for no effect is strong For the reanalysis of the EOLIA trial, the strongly enthusiastic prior is defined as log(RR) ~ \\(N(0.67, 0.25^2)\\). 4.3 Historical data (meta-analysis) 4.4 Hierarchical priors 4.5 Shrinkage priors References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).

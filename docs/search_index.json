Thomas Bayes was a Presbyterian Minister who is thought to have been born in 1701 and died 1761. Bayesian approach were never really practiced in Bayes lifetime. His work was developed and popularized by Pierre-Simon Laplace (17491827) in the early 19th century. Though Bayes developed his philosophy during the 1740s, it wasnt until the late twentieth century that this work reached a broad audience. During the more than two centuries in between, the frequentist philosophy dominated statistical research and practice. Frequentist ideas came to predominate in the 20th century as a result of the work of Fisher (1890-1962), Neyman (1894-1981) and Egon Pearson (1984-1980). Reasons why the Bayesian approach did not catch on until relatively recently: debate of Bayesian philosophy and computational power. Bayes rule by Bayes He essentially used probabilistic terms to express arguments about the uncertainty for the parameter of a binomial model Given the number of times in which an unknown event has happened and failed: Required the chance that the probability of its happening in a single trial lies somewhere between any two degrees of probability that can be named. unknown event = e.g., Bernoulli trial probability of its happening in a single trial \\(=p\\) We may know ahead of time, or not (e.g. \\(p=0.5\\) for a fair coin) The Monty Hall Problem and the Bayesian solution by Marilyn vos Savant Suppose youre on a game show, and youre given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows whats behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, Do you want to pick door No. 2? Is it to your advantage to switch your choice? From wikipedia, Vos Savants response was that the contestant should switch to the other door. Many readers of vos Savants column refused to believe switching is beneficial and rejected her explanation. After the problem appeared in Parade, approximately 10,000 readers, including nearly 1,000 with PhDs, wrote to the magazine, most of them calling vos Savant wrong (Tierney 1991). We will revisit this problem in session 2 on Probability. I provided a short R simulation below to demonstrate why the contest should switch door - higher chance of winning the game. Monty Hall simulation in R set.seed(890123) monty &lt;- function(switch=F) { doors &lt;- sample(c(&#39;car&#39;, &#39;goat&#39;, &#39;goat&#39;), size=3, replace = FALSE) pick &lt;- sample(1:3, size=1, replace = FALSE) #randomly pick 1 door out of the three doors; # Using logic true or false to determine a win; if (switch==T) { # if you chose to switch, you win if the car is not behind the picked door; win &lt;- ifelse(doors[pick] != &#39;car&#39;, 1, 0) } else { # if you chose not to switch, you win if the car is behind the picked door; win &lt;- ifelse(doors[pick] == &#39;car&#39;, 1, 0) } return(win) #return the winning outcome for each game; } # run the game for 1000 iterations; # and record a vector of winning status for not switch and switch; no_switch_win &lt;- sapply(1:1000, FUN=function(i) monty(switch=F)) switch_win &lt;- sapply(1:1000, FUN=function(i) monty(switch=T)) print(paste(&quot;Chance of winning if we always not switch: &quot;, sum(no_switch_win)/1000)) ## [1] &quot;Chance of winning if we always not switch: 0.37&quot; print(paste(&quot;Chance of winning if we always switch: &quot;, sum(switch_win)/1000)) ## [1] &quot;Chance of winning if we always switch: 0.668&quot; The recent rise in popularity Advances in computing Re-evaluation of subjectivity of Bayesian approach due to its use of priors Key discussion on subjectivity by Gelman (Gelman and Hennig 2017) In discussions of the foundations of statistics, objectivity and subjectivity are seen as opposites. Objectivity is typically seen as a good thing; many see it as a major requirement for good science. Bayesian statistics is often presented as being subjective because of the choice of a prior distribution. It has been argued that the subjectiveobjective distinction is meaningless because all statistical methods, Bayesian or otherwise, require subjective choices, but the choice of prior distribution is sometimes held to be particularly subjective because, unlike the data model, it cannot be determined even in the asymptotic limit. 2.3.2 History of this course Prof. George Tomlinson created this course back in 2004 He taught this course from 2004 to 2017 and again from 2020 to 2021. Prof. Nicholas Mitsakakis taught it in 2019. This is my first time teaching this course. We are making history together =) I have borrowed a lot of course materials from George. Thank you George! Juan Pablo will be our guest lecturer this year! 2.4 Thinking like a Bayesian using the concept of probability 2.4.1 Probability is not unitary Mathematically probability is clearly defined (a quantity between 0 and 1 etc., we will talk about this in session 2) There are a few ways of interpreting probability, most notably, long run relative frequency and subjective probability. 1. Long run relative frequency The classical or frequentist way of interpreting probability is based on the proportion of times an outcome occurs in a large (i.e. approaching infinity) number of repetitions of an experiment. This view has various serious problems, including that it requires the outcome to be observable and the experiment to be indeed repeatable! 2. Subjective probability The alternative way (essentially proposed by Bayes, LaPlace, other later prominent Bayesians) is the subjective probability. It encompasses ones views, opinions or beliefs about an event or statement. This event does not have to be repeatable or the outcome observable. It is based on belief. Using this approach, we can express the uncertainty around parameters using probability distributions (e.g., beta distribution for the risk \\(\\theta\\) of death after an operation) Example from (Johnson, Ott, and Dogucu, n.d.) Exercise 2.2 (Different interpretation of probability/uncertainty) When flipping a fair coin, we say that the probability of flipping Heads is 0.5. How do you interpret this probability? If I flip this coin over and over, roughly 50% will be Heads. Heads and Tails are equally plausible. Both a and b make sense. An election is coming up and a pollster claims that candidate A has a 0.6 probability of winning. How do you interpret this probability? If we observe the election over and over, candidate A will win roughly 60% of the time. Candidate A is much more likely to win than to lose. The pollsters calculation is wrong. Candidate A will either win or lose, thus their probability of winning can only be 0 or 1. In the coin flip example, a Bayesian would conclude that Heads and Tails are equally likely. In contrast, a frequentist would conclude that if we flip the coin over and over and over, roughly 1/2 of these flips will be Heads. 2.4.2 Bayes Rule Bayes rule specifies how a prior probability \\(P(H)\\) of event \\(H\\) is updated in response to the evidence/data \\(E\\) to obtain the posterior probability \\(P(H|E)\\). \\[ P(H|E) = \\frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \\] Event \\(H\\) represents a particular hypothesis1 (or model or parameter) Event \\(E\\) represents observed evidence (or data or information) \\(P(H)\\) is the unconditional or prior probability of \\(H\\) (prior to observing \\(E\\)) \\(P(H|E)\\) is the conditional or posterior probability of \\(H\\) after observing evidence \\(E\\). \\(P(E|H)\\) is the likelihood of evidence \\(E\\) given hypothesis (or model or parameter) \\(H\\) The Bayesian approach provides a probability of the hypothesis given the data/evidence, which is something generally highly desirable from a scientific perspective. 2.4.3 The Scientific Method in steps Define the question or problem Assess the currently available information decide whether it is sufficient or not 2.1 If yes: conclusions, decisions, actions 2.2 If no, proceed to step 3. Determine what additional information is needed and design a study or experiment to obtain it Carry out the study designed in step 3. Use the data obtained in step 4 to update what was previously known. Return to step 2. Bayesian Advantages: Bayesian methods are especially good in step 2 and 5 They can be used for representing well existing knowledge and also to explicitly update uncertainty using new evidence. This is a done in a coherent, natural way. The ELISA test for HIV was widely used in the mid-1990s for screening blood donations. As with most medical diagnostic tests, the ELISA test is not perfect. If a person actually carries the HIV virus, experts estimate that this test gives a positive result 97.7% of the time. (This number is called the sensitivity of the test.) If a person does not carry the HIV virus, ELISA gives a negative (correct) result 92.6% of the time (the specificity of the test). Assume the estimated HIV prevalence at the time was 0.5% of (the prior base rate). Suppose a randomly selected individual tested positive: If we know the likelihood of getting a positive test if HIV is truly present, \\(P(T^+ \\mid D^+) = 0.977\\), and the likelihood of getting a positive test if HIV is not present, \\(P(T^+ \\mid D^-) = 1 - 0.926 = 0.074\\), Using the Bayes Rule, we can calculate the posterior probability of the disease given the result, \\(P(D^+ \\mid T^+)\\) \\[\\begin{aligned} P(D^+ \\mid T^+) &amp; = \\frac{\\text{Chance of HIV positive and test positive} )}{\\text{Chance of test positive}}\\\\ &amp; = \\frac{P(D^+ \\text{and } T^+)}{P(T^+)} \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{P(T^+ \\mid D^+)P(D^+)}{P(T^+)} \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{P(T^+ \\mid D^+)P(D^+)}{P(T^+ \\mid D^+)P(D^+) + P(T^+ \\mid D^-)P(D^-)} \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{0.977*0.005}{0.977*0.005 + 0.074*0.995} = \\frac{0.0049}{0.0785} = 0.0622 \\end{aligned}\\] We will review probability rules in session 2 in details. Demonstrate calculation in R library(tidyverse) hypothesis = c(&quot;Carries HIV&quot;, &quot;Does not carry HIV&quot;) prior = c(0.005, 1 - 0.005) likelihood = c(0.977, 1 - 0.926) # given positive test product = prior * likelihood posterior = product / sum(product) bayes_table = data.frame(hypothesis, prior, likelihood, product, posterior) %&gt;% add_row(hypothesis = &quot;Sum&quot;, prior = sum(prior), likelihood = NA, product = sum(product), posterior = sum(posterior)) knitr::kable(bayes_table, digits = 4, align = &#39;r&#39;) hypothesis prior likelihood product posterior Carries HIV 0.005 0.977 0.0049 0.0622 Does not carry HIV 0.995 0.074 0.0736 0.9378 Sum 1.000 NA 0.0785 1.0000 To summarize conceptually we have some belief about the state of the world, expressed as a mathematical model (such as the linear model used in regression). The Bayesian approach provides an updated belief as a weighted combination of prior beliefs regarding that state and the currently available evidence, with the possibility of the current evidence overwhelming prior beliefs, or prior beliefs remaining largely intact in the face of scant evidence. \\[ \\text{updated belief} = \\text{current evidence} \\times \\text{prior belief or evidence} \\] References "],["lab1-getting-started-with-r-rstudio.html", "Lab1 Getting started with R &amp; Rstudio 2.5 R and Rstudio Installation 2.6 R Packages 2.7 Working in Rstudio 2.8 Basic R (a crash introduction)", " Lab1 Getting started with R &amp; Rstudio 2.5 R and Rstudio Installation R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics (https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html). Many users of R like a tool called RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/). This software is what is called an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R. It has several nice features, including docked windows for your console and syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting and workspace management. 2.5.1 Windows operating system install R, https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/ install Rstudio, https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download YouTube Instruction 2.5.2 macOS operating system install R, https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/ install Rstudio, https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download (select macOS 10.14+ option) YouTube Instruction 2.6 R Packages Packages are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include reusable R functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data.(Wickham 2015) To load the functions in a given package, we first have to install the package. We do this using the install.packages() function. Run the line of code that installs the tidyverse package below by removing the # at the start of the second line to uncomment the code. R will install the package to a default directory on your computer. If any dialogue box prompts you to set up a personal library instead, click yes. Once we have the package installed, we must load the functions from this library so we can use them within R. # install.packages(tidyverse, dependencies = T) #uncomment this line if you haven&#39;t installed this package; library(tidyverse) # load package library The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures (https://www.tidyverse.org/). The core packages are ggplot2 (data visualization), dplyr(dataframe manipulation), tidyr(data reshaping), readr(reading datasets), purrr (function and iterations) and tibble(dataframe). 2.6.1 Bayesian Analysis in R using brms package The course will mainly use the brms package in R(Bürkner 2017), which offers a standard R-modelling type interface to the underlying computing engine Stan. Direct use of Stan is not ideal for teaching Bayesian methods. The brms package automatically writes Stan code that can be viewed and edited, so after learning brms, the enterprising student may want to use this Stan code as a steppingstone toward programming directly in Stan. The brms package can be installed and loaded in the same way as any other R package, in this case by typing the following commands in R: #uncomment this line if you haven&#39;t installed this package; # install.packages(brms) library(brms) 2.7 Working in Rstudio 2.7.1 Rstudio layout When you open RStudio, your interface is made up of four panes as shown below. These can be organised via menu options View &gt; Panes &gt; Rstudio layout We can run code in the console at the prompt where R will evaluate it and print the results. However, the best practice is to write your code in a new script file so it can be saved, edited, and reproduced. To open a new script, we select File &gt; New File &gt; R Script. To run code that was written in the script file, you can highlight the code lines you wish be evaluated and press CTRL-Enter (windows) or Cmd+Return (Mac). Additionally, You can comment or uncomment script lines by pressing Ctrl+Shift+C (windows) or Cmd+Shift+C (Mac). The comment operator in R is #. You can find more RStuio default keyboard shortcuts here. In our first tutorial, we will also introduce Rmarkdown, a R version of the markdown file editor that can write and output document in html, word, or pdf format that contents not only the programming code but also any evaluation outputs and graphs. To read more about Rmarkdown, please visit https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html. 2.7.2 Customization You can customize your Rstudio session under the Options dialog Tools &gt; Global Options menu (or RStudio &gt; Preferences on a Mac). A list of customization categories can be found here, https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200549016-Customizing-RStudio. For example, its popular to change Rstudio appearance and themes (e.g., mordern, sky, dark, and classic). 2.7.3 Working directory The working directory is the default location where R will look for files you want to load and where it will put any files you save. You can use function getwd() to display your current working directory and use function setwd() to set your workding directory to a new folder on your computer. One of the great things about using RStudio Projects is that when you open a project it will automatically set your working directory to the appropriate location. getwd() #show my current working directory; ## [1] &quot;D:/GitHub/bayes_bookdown&quot; 2.7.4 Getting help with R The help section of R is extremely useful if you need more information about the packages and functions that you are currently loaded. You can initiate R help using the help function help() or ?, the help operator. help(brms) 2.8 Basic R (a crash introduction) A more comprehensive introduction to base R can be found at https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html. In this subsection, I will briefly outline some common R functions and commands for arithmetic, creating and working with object, vector, matrix, and data. This short introduction is created using the intro to R workshop notes by Prof. Kevin Thorpe as well as multiple open-source materials. Some important notes R is case sensitive. Commands are separated by a newline in the console. The # character can be used to make comments. R doesnt execute the rest of the line after the # symbol - it ignores it. Previous session commands can be accessed via the up and down arrow keys on the keyboard. When naming in R, avoid using spaces and special characters (i.e., !@#$%^&amp;*()_+=;:\"&lt;&gt;?/) and avoid leading names with numbers. 2.8.1 Arithmetic 2*3 2^3 2 + (2 + 3) * 2 - 5 log(3) exp(3) log(exp(1)) #playing with Euler&#39;s number; Exercise 2.3 (Rounding Issues in R) Try evaluating log(0.01^200) and 200*log(0.01) in R.

For thousands of years it has been the traditional land of the Huron-Wendat, the Seneca, and the Mississaugas of the Credit. Today, this meeting place is still the home to many Indigenous people from across Turtle Island and we are grateful to have the opportunity to work on this land.

After a thorough review of fundamental concepts in statistics and probability, an introduction will be given to the fundamentals of the Bayesian approach, including a look at how computer simulation can be used to solve statistical problems. Students will learn how to use the brms package in the R statistical software environment to carry out Bayesian analyses of data commonly seen in health sciences. Bayesian methods will be covered for binary, continuous and count outcomes in one and two samples, for logistic, linear and Poisson regression, and for meta-analysis. By the end of this course, students will: Understand what is meant by a Bayesian Analysis and how it differs from a typical analysis under the frequentist framework Understand the role and importance of Markov Chain Monte Carlo in modern Bayesian methods Understand how modern Bayesian models are fitted Be able to fit Bayesian models to common types of study designs and data types Know what aspects of the Bayesian analysis are an essential part of a statistical report Have worked through some case studies (in lectures, tutorials and as part of assignments) Have developed expertise in using the brms program within the R environment Pre-requisites HAD5316H  Biostatistics II: Advanced Techniques in Applied Regression Methods, Some simple programming (e.g., SAS data step, R, S-Plus)  may be taken concurrently with course.

Academic Integrity Academic integrity is essential to the pursuit of learning and scholarship in a university, and to ensuring that a degree from the University of Toronto is a strong signal of each students individual academic achievement. As a result, the University treats cases of cheating and plagiarism very seriously. Help and information is available on the Academic Integrity website. The University of Torontos Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters (http://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/policies/behaveac.htm) outlines the behaviours that constitute academic dishonesty and the processes for addressing academic offences.
